The DeFi aspect of the protocol also ensures that the user receives and earns from those notifications.\n\n\nBut why Notifications?\nBlockchain still operates like the early era of the internet where you logged in to Gmail to check if a new email had come or went to Orkut to see what your friends wrote about you (yes, we are that old).\u00a0But that is not the norm today, services don\u2019t expect users to come to them, instead they notify the users.

Users can make private, cryptographically secure connections to people they know, using a smartphone app. This pseudonymous connection data is shared among a decentralized group of computer nodes that store and analyze the public social graph. The nodes of the network determine and verify the likely uniqueness of each account, based on its interconnectivity with other accounts.

Giveth & BlockScience have joined forces to build the Commons Stack: a modular library of well-engineered components that create economic designs for creating sustainable funding to Public Goods projects. There is value in Public Goods and we are confident economies can be built to incentivize the creation of this value.\u00a0\n\nUPDATES\n\nWe have several projects ongoing at the moment.\n\nOur main focus is supporting the Token Engineering community in creating the first Commons, the Token Engineering Commons! Which also has it's own grant. Join the TE Discord to follow the progress.\nWe also are working with our own community to build the Commons Simulator, a game that shows the power of cadCAD to parameterize economic systems and their governance.\nWe are proud of the 3 Conviction Voting pilots that are live, thanks to 1Hive! We have our own CV pilot which will be helping to allocate $170,000 worth of $PAN on Gitcoin via the Commons Stack Community Fund.   \n\nWe have started using Github/Zenhub to track our work in detailed issues. If you want to see what we are up to, or even help us take on a few of these issues, we are very open to the idea ;-)\n\nWe are looking to expand the team! If you know any Project Managers, Communication Leads, or Community Managers, have them send their resumes to info [at] commonsstack.org\n\nFunding Iteration 0\n\nDonations to this grant will go to supporting the core functions and responsibilities of the Commons Stack. We will be using these donations to map out our deliverable roadmaps and budgets for each project, expand our communications, confirm our legal strategy, grow the Trusted Seed, and do all the other work we need to do to champion the Commons Stack! \n\nWe have open accounting! All funds raised will be spent transparently in our Iteration 0 Campaign on the Giveth DApp. \n\nOur Plan\n\nOur primary goal is to enable sustainable funding for any nonprofit cause. In the near term, we will focus on enabling economies that can create sustainable funding for the development of open-source infrastructure and open research projects within the blockchain space. To achieve this we will provide a toolkit for communities to create novel, cause-focused economies that we call Commons. \n\nTo build a successful Commons, or any other socio-economic system, a community must consider both the technical and cultural requirements. The Commons Stack mission is to make it easy for cause-focused communities to meet and excel at these requirements so that they can launch a healthy Commons.\n\nOn the Technical side we want to:\n\n1. Support cadCAD: We want to create and fund an independent team to manage the open-source development of cadCAD.\n\n2. Simulate our Components: We want to validate the design of all the Commons components by building open-source, modular cadCAD models that can be forked and applied to other crypto projects.\n\n3. Build our Components: We want to work with various development teams in the space to build modular DApps that can be customized for each Commons component\u2019s parameterization including the Augmented Bonding Curve and Conviction Voting modules.\u00a0\n\n4. Iterate our Components: We have an iterative build strategy, building Commons with a focus on one core component at a time, and then incorporating improvements into successive iterations. The first iteration will focus on the Augmented Bonding Curve. The second iteration will focus on the Giveth Proposal Engine while also advancing the ABC component, and so on. \n\nOn the Cultural side we want to:\n\n1. Grow the Trusted Seed: Starting any project is aided greatly by having people on your side who have done it before. The Trusted Seed is a curated community of prosocial Commons \u201cexperts\u201d that will learn how Commons work and can be trusted to seed many future Commons with their expertise. This is the primary focus of Iteration 0.\n\n2. Maintain a How to DAO Wiki: A Commons is simply a cause-focused DAO with a well designed economic framework. Many DAOs have succeeded and failed in the last few years and we want to create and collect case studies that can be used to derive a list of best practices that can help all DAOs learn from the past to build a successful future. \n\n3. Support Commons\u2019 Cultural Build: Before any code is written, communities need to ensure they have strategies for following Ostrom\u2019s 8 principles and develop their culture in a way that lends itself to successfully using our tech. This is the Focus of the Token Engineering Commons.\n\n4. Create a Cultural Playbook: For the Commons to become widespread, the Commons Stack Core team cannot become a bottleneck. Our Commons Cultural Playbook will document how to successfully complete a Commons Cultural Build.\n\n\nTracking your Support\n\nDonors that support this grant will receive CSTK tokens if their donation is more than 100 DAI (or equivalent value), and they apply to be part of our Trusted Seed.\u00a0\n\n\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-15T05:30:15.581Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks, 2\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-1.2614", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/griffgreen", "handle": "griffgreen", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/6e1318f1c48037b6a5b8188527d2c742/griffgreen.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 3111.36570946889, 0.0], [1.0, 3188.06748640647, 76.7017769375807], [10.0, 3251.53528722878, 140.169577759891], [100.0, 3309.36562527033, 197.999915801444], [1000.0, 3342.6360322672, 231.270322798309], [10000.0, 3356.41574882673, 245.050039357843]], "last_clr_calc_date": "10\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "9\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "874.5701", "positive_round_contributor_count": 88, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "51.8000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "the-commons-stack-iteration-0", "url": "/grants/539/the-commons-stack-iteration-0", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0x6E60609Be6c96efc4899440BCE006C1F4d33A2A4", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x8110d1D04ac316fdCACe8f24fD60C86b810AB15A", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 149, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/55489dd9b0bb55d2454115c8ad6f6b6f/rotkehlchen_logo.png", "details_url": "/grants/149/rotki-the-portfolio-tracker-and-accounting-tool-t", "title": "Rotki - The portfolio tracker and accounting tool that protects your privacy", "description": "What is Rotki?\n\nRotki is an open source portfolio tracking, accounting, analytics and tax reporting tool that protects your privacy.\n\nThe mission of Rotki is to bring transparency into the crypto and financial sectors through the use of open source. Most importantly unlike virtually every other competing service which consists of closed source SaaS onto which you are forced to hand over all your financial data, with Rotki your data is stored encrypted locally in your computer. It enables you to take ownership of your financial data.\n\nWhy a Gitcoin Grant?\n\nWe are using this Gitcoin grant to attempt to partially fund the development of the project. Funding opensource work is a hard problem and we want to try what Gitcoin can do towards alleviating that problem. Especially since we currently have a ton of feature requests (https://github.com/rotki/rotki/issues) and we are but 2 people working on it full-time. The project is at the moment self-funded. Proper funding would change that and allow us to get more developers and better infrastructure to provide better experience for our users.\n\nResults of Grants round 6\n\nWe want to sincerely thank all the people who contributed to the 5th Gitcoin grant CLR round!\nThanks to your 3000 DAI and the 2507 DAI matched by the CLR we managed to gather about 5500$. It's not a sustainable amount to keep us going for 3 months (the amount of time between the CLR rounds) but it's still a great help. Especially considering we were the 10th top grant of the tech round.\nThank you!\n\nWhat have we achieved since then?\n\nGitcoin grants round 6 ended in the start of July 2020. In about 2 months we took your trust in us earnestly and have managed to do a lot of things!\n\nA small summary of the post follows here:\nReleased rotki v1.6.0, a huge update which contained:\nA whole new look for the rotki UI.\nSupport for aave protocol balances and lending history\nAn overview of user's holdings over multiple DeFi protocols.\nENS support when inputting addresses for tracking.\n...and more. For dull details check the release notes.\nReleased rotki v1.6.1 which contained:\nImprovements for Ubuntu users\nFixes a breaking bug\n...and more. For full details check the release notes.\nReleased rotki v1.6.2 which contained:\nAbility to specify addresses to be queried per DeFi protocol and which DeFi protocols to query. Saves a lot of time during historical balance querying.\nRemoved Fiat Balances in favor of manually tracked balances.\nNew more robust way of detecting user owned tokens. Alethio is no longer used.\nAbility to purge exchange and ethereum data cached in the DB.\n...and more. For full details check the release notes.\nReleased rotki v1.7.0 which contained\nUsers can now explore their ethereum transactions.\nUsers can now explore their exchange+manual trades.\nUsers can now explore their deposit/withdrawals to/from exchanges.\nYearn finance vaults and curve pools are now automatically tracked across all accounts\nNew icons for all supported assets!\nCrypto.com mobile app import supported\nCustomization of number displays\n...and a lot more. For full details check the release notes.\n\nWhy should you contribute?\n\nTo help us keep developing an opensource tool that supports your privacy.\nWe plan to integrate with most of the major DeFi platforms available today in the network.\n\nThat is:\nCompound lending and borrowing (Coming very soon v1.8.0)\nYearn finance vaults historical accounting (Coming very soon v1.8.0)\nSupport uniswap exchange trades\n... and more (if you have any suggestions please contact us in discord/telegram/twitter -- links below)\n\nIf you like what we are doing and want to help us achieve our mission you can donate as much you want via this Grant. Even 1 DAI counts, if it's happening during the CLR round thanks to the fund matching mechanism.\n\nAll funds we get from this grant will go towards development of ethereum features for Rotki. Either those outlined above or others that you request of us.\n\nHelp us create software that will enable you to take ownership of your financial data!\n\nOther ways to help us\n\nDid you contribute?

RxC advances plurality, equality and community, through upgrades of democracy, markets, property rights, the data economy, the commons and collective intelligence governance.\n\u00a0\nFounded by E. Glen Weyl in the wake of public discussion about the publication of his book Radical Markets in 2018, the RadicalxChange Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to that cause.\n\nRxC connects people from all walks of life - ranging from social scientists and technologists to artists and activists. The movement is ever evolving and always welcoming new people and ideas to make our social world more diverse, equal, and free.\n\nRXC CONCEPTS\nCommon Partial Ownership - Data Dignity - Intersectional Identity - Quadratic Funding and Voting - Radical Antitrust\n\nThe ideas inspiring the RadicalxChange movement have their roots in the book Radical Markets \u2013 but they are by no means limited to them. Instead, they grow and evolve, based on new research, feedback from the community, and what we learn from trying these ideas out in the real world.\n\nNETWORKED CONVERSATIONS\nRadicalxChange brings public conversations about democracy, markets, and our shared values into the 21st century.\nConferences help develop a powerful global network of forward-thinking, bold, and responsible policymakers, entrepreneurs, and intellectuals.\nVarious audio and video formats help spread the word about RxC concepts and reach a wider audience.\nSocial media channels help to connect with a broad public, not just academics and policymakers.\n\nSee past conference sessions on our YouTube channel or tune into the RxC Replayed podcast.\n\nGITXCHANGE2: QUADRATIC FUNDING HACKATHON\nThe Quadratic Funding Hackathon is a program designed by RadicalxChange Foundation and Gitcoin to lay the ground for a variety of Quadratic Funding ecosystems. Quadratic Funding is a new form of matching funding that democratically incentivizes contributions to public and shared goods and services.

As such, many other project can be built on top of it. But how can we allocate funds and efforts to these projects who are part of the DAppNode ecosystem? The answer is: the community can - not us. The users, the builders, those contributing and participating to create a better, more useful DAppNode should be encouraged to do so. So all the PAN contributions to this Gitcoin Grants round and its matching will go straight back to this community, with the vision that a stronger community and more projects working on top of DAppNode are what will increase the utility, usability and ultimately determine the success of the project. \n\nFirst Goal (500$ - 3,500$)\u00a0\n\nThe DAppNode community is evolving. In order to support this growth and reward the most active community members, our first goal will be directed towards a community treasury to reward the best contributions.\nThis community treasury will be based on Sourcecred and will be ignited with the money received from this grant round. The donations will be used as the seed funds to distribute among the most active members of the community, who later can decide to stake into our cluster (and generate a virtuous circle) or cash out. \nThese people represent the most active and participative users in the DappNode community, those who help other members with support, those who contribute with ideas or those who build on top of DAppNode. \n\nSecond Goal (above 3500$)\n\nAnything above the seed fund will be donated to other projects, with the purpose of creating DAppNode packages of their products. By creating a scheme of Package Champions that will steward the maintenance of the package and of Package Developers, who will create the actual DNPs, we will be donating to projects that have demonstrated interest in integrating with DAppNode: Rotki, Trueblocks, BrightID... and packages that the community members have requested: ETH2.0 validation tools, other PoS networks... The community will decide!\n\nDAppNode is the Decentralized Infrastructure of the Web3\n\nContributing to DAppNode's grant is to contribute to a fully decentralized vision of the blockchain ecosystem: \nWe want to enable decentralized infrastructure for the world by shifting the value captured by the cloud giants to the participants at the edges, destroying the barriers of entry for participation: that is, to enable anyone to get paid by maintaining the infrastructure of the internet.\n\nWe have identified two tracks that will stimulate decentralization in the short to mid term and we will dedicate 1/2 of the Grant to each of the tracks: \n\n1- Knowledge, dissemination and creation of TRUE DApps.\n2- Ethereum 2.0 validation.\u00a0\n\nMost DApps are not decentralized. Nobody is to blame for that: To begin with, DApps need access to nodes to work: that means either become a centralizing vector yourself and maintain your own node at a considerable cost and headache, or go to another player that does that at scale and is more efficient but also has more power over the data - Infura or other Node-as-a-Service providers. A DApp developer does not necessarily want to be an infrastructure provider, so it\u2019s just normal that it would pay someone to do so.\u00a0\n\nSecondly, DApps need to be as usable and accessible as any other app - which means that they need to go through the distribution channels users are used to: a website, an app store, etc. Considering that accessing decentralized websites requires extra steps from the user (like using an IPFS gateway to access decentralized front-ends, for example), and we want to make it easier for her, it is just easier to use a standard hosting service that most likely ends up in AWS, GC or Azure.\n\nSo... have we lost the decentralization war to an inevitable but insidious prioritization exercise?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be. Let open source come to the rescue. We will spend half of the Gitcoin Grant Round 5 on Gitcoin Bounties targeted at decentralizing commonly used DApps, and the other half on ETH2.0 research (more on that later).\u00a0\n\nHow are we going to use Bounties to create a more truly decentralized ecosystem?\nReward DApps to maintain their own decentralized front end (IPFS/.eth domain)\nReward Developers to include the option for users to connect to their own node (it\u2019s unbelievable how this is NOT a default in all DApps!)\nReward Developers to create DAppNode packages of their DApps.\nReward Open Source contributors to develop and maintain packages, (like Nate Gentile\u2019s light & local block explorer).\u00a0\n\nThe second half of the grant will be spent on what has the potential to decentralize the Ethereum network, if done correctly: Eth2.0 and its openness for validation. We hope that DAppNode will be the easiest way to deploy and maintain a validator with minimal effort! But in order to future-proof this\u00a0\n\nAll of this, free and open source. Get your DAppNode at install.dappnode.io or get your plug-and-play hardware solution at shop.dappnode.io.\n\n\n\nConsensys Grants final report: \nDAppNode is the easiest way to run decentralized infrastructure. Install our Free (& Gratis) Open Source Software, a couple of clicks and boom, you\u2019re running a local node of whatever network you want to support. No technical knowledge needed and even less if you get the plug-and-play hardware from our shop! Plug to your router, you\u2019re game.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve devoted a lot of work to make every piece of it completely decentralized. Using it will never require you to connect to a central server (because DAppNode is a fat client and self-contains Ethereum and IPFS nodes, it connects directly to these decentralized networks!). We even created a decentralized auto-update system so infrastructure maintenance is even more hands-free.\u00a0\n\nThe thesis is decentralization empowers people (with sovereignty over their own data, with access to unstoppable services). The antithesis is only a few have the technical knowledge to be empowered this way. The synthesis is DAppNode breaks down all technical barriers for everyone to participate in this decentralized networks.\u00a0\nAnd it works! Promise is fulfilled and we are working every day to make it more user-friendly, easier to understand and to maintain and bring the world closer to an ideal where there are no cloud providers and everyone can participate into a crypto-network that helps them offer their hardware to an infrastructure protocol (or several) and get rewarded for it.\u00a0\nAh, but there was a use case that we couldn\u2019t figure out. Let\u2019s hear it through the story of our type user, Paco:\n\nPaco is privacy-conscious. He doesn\u2019t want his data floating around but also he doesn\u2019t want anyone\u2019s data floating around so it can be used on them at every election by the myriad of Cambridge Analytica spin-offs. He sees that as a threat to democracy. Hence he sees the value of decentralization through blockchains: protocols that only keep the data they need on-chain and users know in advance which data that is; or protocols that store information in a way that can be accessed without being recorded and in an unstoppable and uncensorable way.\u00a0\nPaco is tech-savvy, compared to most, but not a developer nor comfortable with command line. He\u2019s an early adopter of tech. He got excited by Bitcoin\u2019s promise of a decentralized pseudonymous digital currency in the early days, and that\u2019s how he got into crypto. He uses Signal as his main messaging app. He uses DAppNode to run an Ethereum node and a Monero node and regularly experiments with new projects thanks to DAppNode\u2019s ever-growing list of packages.\u00a0\nHe transacts happily, broadcasting the transactions through his own nodes, accessing .eth domains through his local IPFS node. But he can only do so when he\u2019s at home, next to his DAppNode.\nIf he wants to do a transaction when he\u2019s at the office, or at a cafe, or at the hotel during a business trip, he has no way to connect to his node because his home connection has a Dynamic IP that keeps changing so he has no way to find it.\u00a0\n\nAlright Paco, this is a hard problem but we gotchu. We have created a DNS server so your DAppNode will have a public address that you can look for and in the background it will update with its new IP. Not ideal, we know, but we collect no data from this server. \u201cDecentralize till it hurts, centralize until it works\u201d!\nThis was the only compromise. In the name of UX and serving users, there was that DNS server! But, could we fully decentralize our solution? Is there a way to create a Decentralized Dynamic DNS? Enter Consensys Grants.\u00a0\nMilestone 1. Codename \u201cD\u201d for Decentralized and \u201cD\u201d for Dynamic\nWell it turns out it is possible. We analyzed different protocols like ZeroNet, Swarm FEEDS and libp2p and decided that probably the best way to go for this use case was libp2p. ZeroNet and Swarm FEEDS could be used, but they either had too much overhead or they would require a radical change on sizeable parts of DAppNode\u2019s codebase.\u00a0\nAt the end of Milestone 1 we had a libp2p PoC that allowed two machines to discover each other in the vast internets, connect securely and start exchanging. See the video in milestone 2 for more information (the full DDDNS works according to the same principles as the PoC).\u00a0\nMilestone 2. Codename \u201cDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDNS\u201d. Ok, that\u2019s too many D\u2019s. Call D cops.\u00a0\u00a0\nObjective was to create a working system that could scale and could be implemented in DAppNode or other projects in need of a similar solution.\u00a0\nWhat better way to show it than with a video?\nhttps://youtu.be/YsKhGEbucnc\nMilestone 3. Codename \u201cDDDeploy\u201d. We were running out of ideas for names \ud83e\udd37\nMilestone 3 was to deploy it in our production version of DAppNode so Paco would be able to use it to connect to his RPC endpoints from wherever, leveraging only decentralized systems.\u00a0\nDAppNode\u2019s DDDNS system is not in production yet. DNSs are such a deeply ingrained part of the internet that it\u2019s hard to just replace it. Unless we want to reinvent the wheel, which would take a lot more work, we depend on other actors integrating with our system. The good news is that thanks to Open Source, we have identified how it could integrate with WireGuard\u2019s VPN so a user would be able to open a VPN tunnel from the client to their DAppNode using our system.\u00a0\nSo now we are in the process of integrating it as an internal system of discovery for DAppNodes to communicate with each other, which will enable things like federations or peer monitoring.\n\u00a0\nMost of the questions for the final report have been addressed above. Let\u2019s directly respond to those which haven\u2019t:\n\nIn your opinion, what is the most remarkable accomplishment or finding of your project?\nThis project has been a journey of discovery. We stumbled upon protocols that amazed us by their cleverness, and experimented with amazing tech. But the single most remarkable finding keeps being the astounding potential of Open Source. We could test, iterate, modify different approaches and basically build on the shoulders of giants. Every line of code we tested is a reflection of a design goal and a technological and even philosophical approach. While this is not a surprise to anyone, we feel that in the time where Open Source public goods are struggling to find its place or ensure its survival, it is worth highlighting how much progress can be made thanks to them.\u00a0\n\nTo what extent did this work contribute to the greater open source ethereum community.\nEver wanted a way to connect two machines in a completely decentralized way? To serve from your server to a client without having to register in any DNS? Have a look at that, it\u2019s for everyone to use: https://github.com/dappnode/DDDNS\n\nLast but not least, we want to thank the Consensys Grants team for everything that they have made for the Grantees. We have received opportunities to promote our product, to receive feedback on investment pitches, to learn about other projects, to get in touch with different teams at Consensys, to easily access Consensys products and consensys-backed products with discounts or \u201cgrantee\u201d treatment\u2026 We felt accompanied throughout and we felt a genuine attempt to help us in any way possible. This was clearly the best part of the grant.\u00a0\n\n\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-24T10:15:15.060Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week ago", "sybil_score": "-0.8182", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "INFRA TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/eduadiez", "handle": "eduadiez", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/98ada20e0037888e6357300a4ae0a010/eduadiez.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 24695.5017124759, 0.0], [1.0, 24898.4595632845, 202.957850808638], [10.0, 25048.7819009903, 353.280188514473], [100.0, 25177.5976530378, 482.095940561943], [1000.0, 25248.9780789051, 553.476366429266], [10000.0, 25278.2110961506, 582.709383674744]], "last_clr_calc_date": "a minute from now", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "21\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "4349.8888", "positive_round_contributor_count": 165, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "81.2400", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "dappnode-panvala-league", "url": "/grants/143/dappnode-panvala-league", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0xd1D95220882fB4F53604D9ec5d45675814a130A4", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x00CF36853AA4024fb5BF5cc377dfd85844B411a0", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 416, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/ddbe712d66d1303e3a0442b1a5aab112/iearn-x-curve.png", "details_url": "/grants/416/yearnfinance", "title": "yearn.finance", "description": "DeFi made simple.\r\n\r\nyearn.finance\r\n\r\nThe purpose of yearn.finance is simple.

This was better than nothing at first, but was burning through over $800+ a month alone in credits - so we knew it wasn't sustainable.\r\n\r\nFrom that point, Dan from PieDAO had reached out and kindly offered to sponsor us the money to run 1-2 more archive nodes/month, still in the cloud - but luckily not with AWS so it was magnitudes cheaper.\r\n\r\nThis was very generous and to this day Dan is still supporting our project as a whole (with the AWS credits on the backburner), but once again, this is not sustainable, and we cannot rely on Dan to pay our bills.\r\n\r\nWe are creating this grant in hopes to deploy physical hardware capable of supporting archive nodes.\r\n\r\nThe ideal setup would be to have us running at least two physical hardware nodes operating out of separate locations. The second for redundancy. This puts our operating costs to a minimum (only electricity) and also allows for the project to remain much more sustainable in the future.\r\n\r\nSo, what is the purpose of ArchiveNode.io?\r\n\r\nWe want to benefit the Ethereum community by offering developers and the likes access to archive nodes for education, development, research, whatever - without having to break the bank. Right now, they're looking to pay upwards of ~$1,500+ (more if they expect redundancy) for an archive node, otherwise they have the option of paying Infura $250/month. We realize this isn't right, nor affordable for small time devs - which is the purpose we serve.\r\n\r\nWe charge nothing for a developer to utilize our archive nodes.\r\n\r\nTo date, we have received over 100 requests for archive node access, majority of which have been accepted.\r\n\r\nWe would very much appreciate any and all support on our grant, in hopes to fund physical hardware for our project!\r\n\r\nThank you.", "last_update": "2020-09-15T15:51:15Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks, 1\u00a0day ago", "sybil_score": "-0.6471", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "INFRA TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/defidude", "handle": "defidude", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/79216e580dcbfa54b5271200fd68c8cd/defidude.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 11681.6237463217, 0.0], [1.0, 11848.2508915805, 166.627145258797], [10.0, 11967.2096066649, 285.585860343152], [100.0, 12070.0662287731, 388.442482451394], [1000.0, 12127.4753331209, 445.851586799188], [10000.0, 12150.8956751224, 469.271928800646]], "last_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "15\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "9068.8582", "positive_round_contributor_count": 119, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "archivenodeio-the-public-access-ethereum-archive-", "url": "/grants/1101/archivenodeio-the-public-access-ethereum-archive-", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xA3f83326cE7BD51fB6FDFC3D1c7fA76Dc9d52aee", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1093, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/e7740b489f7ea8ed8280e21f3dc41dcf/flash.png", "details_url": "/grants/1093/snapshot", "title": "Snapshot", "description": "Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results.\n\n\u2705Creating a proposal and voting is free no transaction\n\u2705Proposals and votes are just signed messages stored on IPFS \n\u2705Signatures are easily verifiable online they use the \"eth_sign\" format \n\u2705We don't have any token or business model, and no plans to get one\n\u2705It's free to create a space it take 5mn to add one\n\u2705Space can have their custom domain name \n\u2705Space can have their own skin \n\u2705Space can have custom strategies to calculate results \n\u2705Fully open source with MIT license \n\u2705We don't use any tracking or ads in our site\n\n\u2b50100% of the funds will be sent to contributors of the project (Fabien @bonustrack excluded)\n\u2b50We will not spend any fund on marketing\n\u2b50All the fund we receive and transfer we do are visible here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pjmYpvt-vIh_x-lVMdfJBYloWNbA9V35HW0WmOG-XZg\n\u2b50If you donate, you will get a collector Snapshot POAP badge (we will distribute it in the end of the Gitcoin round 7)\n", "last_update": "2020-09-19T06:08:44.228Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 5\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-0.1678", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/bonustrack", "handle": "bonustrack", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/0aed537ee440cae7057db67fa1cced47/bonustrack.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 11976.8099947099, 0.0], [1.0, 12112.4658451035, 135.655850393574], [10.0, 12210.8701432165, 234.060148506611], [100.0, 12298.184344779, 321.374350069083], [1000.0, 12348.1155885227, 371.305593812765], [10000.0, 12368.7589883557, 391.948993645809]], "last_clr_calc_date": "23\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "5878.1957", "positive_round_contributor_count": 149, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "snapshot", "url": "/grants/1093/snapshot", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x8C28Cf33d9Fd3D0293f963b1cd27e3FF422B425c", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 500, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/2432dfa7c5c41c17edcbca6927adccc8/DeFi_Dad_Profile_pic.jpg", "details_url": "/grants/500/defi-dad-defi-tutorials-on-youtube-and-twitter", "title": "DeFi Dad DeFi Tutorials on YouTube and Twitter", "description": "Having been in the Ethereum community over 3 years, I began experimenting with DeFi apps over a year ago. I had traded on centralized exchanges the last few years but having been in SaaS before entering crypto, I was accustomed to doing daily product demos for clients.\n\nBy 2019, I decided to start sharing my own journey dogfooding everything DeFi to prove that more should be trying DeFi, in light of the huge benefits of a censorship-resistant p2p finance system that requires no KYC, no minimum funds, and has no geo restrictions.\n\n\nSince Gitcoin Grants Round 6, here's the results of my free educational DeFi content and how I used Round 6 funds:\n\nMy Twitter account where I post daily DeFi tips and tutorials, is now 3.5 million impressions per month.\nMy YouTube channel DeFi Tutorials with DeFi Dad has attracted over 11,000 subscribers, with over 196,000 views in just the last 90 days.\nI've produced 28 videos over 90 days just on my channel (which is 1 video every 3 days).\nI've produced an additional 24 Bankless Tutorials the past ~24 weeks for Bankless YouTube. Add both channels together, I average a video every 1.5 days.\nI've also produced countless DeFi tutorials for The Defiant, and often write on fundamentals of DeFi.\nI used the Round 6 funds i) to pay a designer to brand my YouTube channel and create a logo for DeFi Tutorials with DeFi Dad, ii) buy a very powerful MacBook Pro for better video editing, and iii) lots of gas I've blown test driving DeFi apps.\n\nSo here's what's next and how I will use Round 7 funding to produce more public goods for the community:\n\nI will use part of the proceeds to pay for this new powerful MacBook Pro I recently bought in light of the improved video editing I'm doing.\nI will likely use part of the money to continue subsidizing the insane amount of gas I pay to test drive DeFi apps in my videos.\nI will continue to create even higher quality content since self-teaching myself to use iMovie by using Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro ($299/year).\nI am finally launching a DeFi Dad Podcast and will use funds to pay for some simple expenses to produce the podcast.\nAs I've stated in the past, I spend about 5 hours a day, 7 days a week, curating and producing DeFi content outside of my day job working now for Zapper. Whatever you want to value my time at, I'd appreciate any funding from the community since I spend that limited time devoted to Ethereum and DeFi content, while raising 2 young kids.\n\nThank you for considering me and even if you don't donate, please follow me at @DeFi_Dad on Twitter and subscribe to the DeFi Tutorials with DeFi Dad YouTube channel!\n", "last_update": "2020-09-16T19:17:37.974Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks ago", "sybil_score": "-0.5247", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/defi-dad", "handle": "defi-dad", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/8533d4c636ffdcab2ed29ce717364834/defi-dad.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 17944.7665646095, 0.0], [1.0, 18136.5685207273, 191.801956117823], [10.0, 18293.6311543959, 348.864589786423], [100.0, 18435.6719830206, 490.905418411054], [1000.0, 18516.7637003907, 571.997135781145], [10000.0, 18550.1384864632, 605.371921853683]], "last_clr_calc_date": "7\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "12\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "2010.7243", "positive_round_contributor_count": 162, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "6.3000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "defi-dad-defi-tutorials-on-youtube-and-twitter", "url": "/grants/500/defi-dad-defi-tutorials-on-youtube-and-twitter", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0xC7d0e2e26E1Ec5BB8A9286bFF9f363D5618B7fA3", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x2f71129b240080C638ac8d993BFF52169E3551c3", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 275, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/f41428962a876dd3f805ac06d15883c5/walletconnect-social.jpg", "details_url": "/grants/275/walletconnect", "title": "WalletConnect", "description": "WalletConnect is an open protocol for connecting desktop Dapps to mobile Wallets using end-to-end encryption by scanning a QR code.

Aiming to allow users seamless connectivity and enjoyment in our Entertainment Systems Platforms.\r\nCrypCade is a revolutionary redesign on old arcades, \u201ccasinos\u201d and \u201cgaming platforms\u201d.\r\n\r\nLaunched on the Tron Network and now integrating into the Matic.Network , our \u201cPatent Pending\u201d designs and multi functionality on the platform, ensure a kind of experience and engagement only to be experienced at CrypCade Ecosystem.\r\n\r\nCrypCade is an Entertainment Ecosystem designed to benefit both user and the platform.\r\nBy making a deposit and playing games on CrypCade, users mine CADE tokens that can be claimed and will be sent to user's wallet automatically upon claiming.\r\n\r\nUsers can freeze CADE tokens in order to gain dividends from the dividend pool. The dividend pool increases with player's losses on in-house games A percentage of partners' games losses also feed into the pool. Wins are credited from the dividend pool.\r\n\r\nDividends are automatically distributed daily to all frozen tokens, Every night at 0:00GMT and are credited to users' wallets upon redeem. Dividends have an expiration period that is mentioned in the Dividends page. Failing to redeem the dividend during this period will result in loss of this dividend.\r\n\r\nDividend distribution:\r\n15% - users\r\n5% - team\r\n5% - reserve\r\n75% - rolls over to the next day's dividends\r\n\r\nPlayers are able to play with the redeemed dividends if so decided and mine more CADE in the process, or withdraw them to the external wallet and end the cycle.\r\n\r\nOur Vision\r\n\r\nMultifunctionality is at our core, which allows the CrypCade matrix to exist and serve as part of our main aims in every milestone.\r\n\r\nWith its high emphasis on large throughput with

token mining economy for sustained growth and anticipation of user influx,CADE token allows powerful DApps to be built on the CrypCade platform for easy integration and release.\r\nCADE token boosts our multifunctionality , purposely enabling user to \u201cown\u201d platform stakes as the platform steams ahead , creating a sustainable and economic environment.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nGeneral mechanics of token mining has been used on multiple platforms.\r\n\r\nIn CrypCade when a user makes a bet within the gaming environment, CADE token mining occurs simultaneously which will be automatically credited to the user\u2019s wallet.\r\nCADE tokens mined within the CrypCade gaming environment are locked within a smart contract.Users will need to withdraw CADE tokens from the smart contract to the user\u2019s wallet, where it can be frozen/staked.\r\nAccess to a share of the Dividend Pool translating into daily passive income (variable upon daily Dividend Pool

A key part of the workflow is for Ethereum core devs, dapp devs, researchers, and other stakeholders, to get feedback on proposals, known as EIPs. This happens in conference calls, in-person, in chat channels, or on the Magicians' Forum.\n\nUntil Spring, 2020, Magicians organized in-person meetings and work sessions during Ethereum community conferences. Due to the pandemic and economic crisis, we have transitioned over to a virtual format for discussions, coordinating with other Ethereum-related groups who are doing the same. In July, 2020 we conducted a live experiment using the Gather platform and Zoom, an approach we will continue to improve on.\n\nThe ongoing benefit that we bring to the community is that our work empowers decision-makers to gather feedback, and encourages developers and researchers to collaborate closely via the Magicians' Forum. This helps make Ethereum the best technology that it can be!\n\nFunds received will be managed by members of the Operations Ring, a group which manages resources for the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians, organizes events, and maintains the Forum. Your donation will be used to organize upcoming events, operate and organize, and pay for maintaining and moderating the Forum.\n\nAll contributions are highly appreciated \ud83d\ude4f\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-28T04:38:32.951Z", "last_update_natural": "3\u00a0days, 9\u00a0hours ago", "sybil_score": "-0.5041", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/anettrolikova", "handle": "anettrolikova", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/fa6bed2ee87a60bc9a1ed94dcb60207c/anettrolikova.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 11962.498554394, 0.0], [1.0, 12116.7238569534, 154.225302559453], [10.0, 12239.8996267728, 277.401072378882], [100.0, 12347.4097700754, 384.911215681459], [1000.0, 12407.2440526107, 444.745498216736], [10000.0, 12431.598766779, 469.100212385003]], "last_clr_calc_date": "5\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "14\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "1190.4245", "positive_round_contributor_count": 121, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "18.6300", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "ethereum-magicians", "url": "/grants/223/ethereum-magicians", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0x3A14071D4E663B1F98e2899D6d1411a6c2A4bD28", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x85cab7143ff3c01b93e88f5b017692374bb939c2", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 238, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/49ba611176763b545c9dbf2fb75c7995/gitcoin-bankless.png", "details_url": "/grants/238/bankless", "title": "Bankless", "description": "Bankless is on a mission to onboard millions of people into living their financial lives on Ethereum. The DeFi ecosystem returns sovereignty and control back into the hands of the individual, and away from top-down authority and rent-seeking middleman.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut, it\u2019s confusing and moves really fast. Education and knowledge is the key to unlocking the power of DeFi to the average individual. There is lots of wealth to be made in this industry, and if this wealth is only accessible to the hyper-connected and highly-skilled, then that wealth will be concentrated rather than diffuse.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBankless tackles this in a number of different ways:\n\nNewsletter - A daily newsletter consisting of tactics, news, and narrative to orient and engage the world into becoming crypto-native\n\u00a0\nPodcast - A primary source of information from the leading minds directly to the ears of thousands\n\u00a0\nYouTube - For the audio/visual learners, quick-hitting and fast-paced content that strives to keep up with DeFi.\n\nThe work is paying off. Over 13k people subscribe to the newsletter, our podcast reaches over 100k downloads every month, and our Getting Started with Bankless Guide has already reach 1 million views! \n\nGITCOIN ROUNDS\n\nThe last two Gitcoin Rounds allowed us grow our Video and International content. As a result, the Bankless YouTube has hit 7,000 subscribers, and Bankless France community is alive and well with over 500 subscribers.

Thank you for helping with this effort!\n\u00a0\nWHAT WE'LL DO WITH THIS ROUND\n\u00a0\nWebsite - Our initial BanklessHQ website needs we major revamp! We want to turn it into a central hub for the various wings of Bankless.\n\nSubnewsletters - The Bankless program is turned for general DeFi education, but we want to cover both beginner topics and deep niches in subnewsletters.\n\nSquad Fund - Writers, animators, meme artists, videographers...they all deserve to be paid! We want to create a fund set aside for a talented squad of freelancers who produce content for the Bankless Nation. \n\nMultilingual - Ethereum knows no borders, yet the world is still fractured into various languages.

With a stealth address, a payer can send Ether or ERC20 tokens to an address controlled by the receiver, but no one except the two parties know who that receiver is. \n\nOn chain, the transaction looks like a simple transfer to an otherwise unused address on the Ethereum network. Off chain, the sender has used a public key published by the receiver using ENS to generate the new address. By encrypting the data used to generate the address, and announcing it via the Umbra smart contract, the sender can let the receiver know they\u2019ve sent them a payment to a new stealth address. Only the receiver can generate the private key needed to withdraw the funds.\n\nBy leveraging Gas Station Network and Uniswap, Umbra enables withdrawers to pay for gas using the tokens they\u2019ve received. This avoids the need to fund stealth addresses with Ether before withdrawing.\n\nAdvantages of Umbra\n\nUmbra allows arbitrary amounts to be sent, since there is no need for inputs and outputs to be uniform.\nUmbra does not require the receiver to wait to withdraw funds\u2014 as soon as they're sent, they can be withdrawn to any address the receiver chooses.\nUmbra ensures only the receiver can withdraw the funds once they're sent. The sender does not hold the private key of the receiving address.\nUmbra uses significantly less gas, as it does not require the verification of any advanced cryptography on chains. All transactions are simple transfers.\nUmbra enables ETH and arbitrary ERC20 tokens to be transferred privately. You're not dependent on a large anonymity set developing for each token.\n\nSample Use Case\n\nAlice owns a business and hires Bob to subcontract for her. She agrees to pay Bob 1,000 Dai/week for his work.\n\nThe first time Bob visits the Umbra app, he sets up his account, enabling hime to be paid privately. Alice uses Umbra to send 1,000 Dai to Bob each week\u2014 she only needs to know his ENS address\n\nOn chain, we see Alice pays 1,000 Dai to a different and otherwise empty address each week. Behind the scenes, Bob controls the keys to each of these addresses via Umbra, but nobody else knows as much.\n\nBob uses Umbra to withdraw his 1,000 Dai each week. He only needs to provide an address to send it to. Obviously, it's best for him to use an address that's not tied to his identity. He usually chooses to send it straight to an exchange, where he sells it for fiat as needed.\n\nBecause Umbra uses Gas Station Network and Uniswap, Bob doesn't have to fund the stealth address with Ether to withdraw his Dai. He can pay for gas with the Dai itself. He can also swap directly to any token of his choice, as long as there's a trading pair available on Uniswap.\n\nHow Does it Work?\n\nBelow is a high level description of the mechanics of the Umbra protocol:\n\nUsers publish signed messages to ENS text records to reveal their Umbra public key. This public key is derived from a random private key specifically generated for use with Umbra.\nA payer uses this public key, plus some randomly generated data, to create a new 'stealth' address.\nThe payer encrypts the random data with the receiver's public key.\nThe payer sends the funds to the shielded address and sends the encrypted message to Umbra's smart contract. The contract broadcasts the encrypted message as an Event.\nThe receiver scans the encrypted messages broadcast by the Umbra contract until they find one they can decrypt with their private key.\nThe receiver uses the contents of the encrypted message, plus their private key, to generate the private key of the stealth address.\nThe receiver uses the private key of the stealth address to sign a withdrawal transaction, sending the ETH or tokens to the address of their choice.\nOptionally, the withdrawal transaction is broadcast via Gas Station Network transaction relayers, obviating the need to fund the stealth address to access tokens. The Umbra contracts swap some of the tokens via Uniswap to pay the GSN relayer for gas.\n\nWhat is the project's status?\n\nNEW: A functional version of the project is available at ropsten.umbra.cash. We hope to bring the protocol to mainnet in the coming months, so your contributions will go primarily towards helping us fund a full security audit!\n\nMore Information\nTwitter\nTelegram\nBlog post\nGitHub\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-15T20:56:32.122Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks, 1\u00a0day ago", "sybil_score": "-0.2394", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "INFRA TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/mds1", "handle": "mds1", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/dc94b111eff300ecdd4b408ff479e0ff/mds1.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 3191.32486411027, 0.0], [1.0, 3290.96566039161, 99.6407962813355], [10.0, 3367.11683502204, 175.791970911766], [100.0, 3435.40936617742, 244.084502067151], [1000.0, 3474.53914557764, 283.214281467371], [10000.0, 3490.73909140831, 299.41422729804]], "last_clr_calc_date": "3\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "16\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "1134.3607", "positive_round_contributor_count": 71, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "umbra-privacy-preserving-stealth-payments", "url": "/grants/821/umbra-privacy-preserving-stealth-payments", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xA735cf11Ed1228feb7C7bb18673A868455ffb16f", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1297, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/af294cafe9be89993ff1132d198c20be/whalerdao_forum.png", "details_url": "/grants/1297/whalerdao", "title": "WhalerDAO", "description": "What is WhalerDAO?\nWe fight DeFi whales to save the world.\n\nWhalerDAO is a community of builders, researchers, legal experts, and community influencers who are dedicated to help solve the plethora of problems that the world is facing, using the power of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nWe call ourselves whalers, because we intend to take the control of DeFi protocols away from the rich & powerful \u201cwhales\u201d and give it into the hands of the people, which is necessary for preventing DeFi from becoming just another tool for the rich to get even richer.\nThe WhalerDAO Manifesto\nThe WhalerDAO Blog\nOur Discord community\n\nWhat we do?\nInfluence - We collaborate with the various DeFi protocols to use governance as an agent for positive sum impact, transitioning from plutocracy to democracy and convincing the communities that DeFi should be used for funding charitable causes. \n\nDevelop - We develop useful tools for the DeFi community to understand how governance power is distributed and how votes are decided.\n\nResearch - We do research into novel models of governance and token distribution that prevent the domination of rich & powerful groups and individuals, such as\u00a0Conviction Voting, Quadratic Voting, Quadratic Funding, and the Windfall Clause\u00a02.\n\nTree\nTREE is the first initiative of WhalerDAO to create a DeFi protocol that benefits charitable causes. \n\nThe value created by TREE will is allocated to several pools, one being a Charity Pool.

We\u2019ve turned down ETH Killers and other avenues which we felt tarnished the purity of what we\u2019re looking to build.\r\n\r\nThis means that everything from gas cost wars to travel, distribution and dealing with Japanese customs accusing us of smuggling drugs has been out of pocket due to our love for Ethereum and the wider community. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve been lucky enough to work with and receive support from Ethereum\u2019s best and brightest talents, all of which are highlighted in POAP\u2019s journey since its creation at ETHDenver in 2019.\r\n\r\nWhile we're extremely saddened by the fact that all of our events where we planned to bring our magic have been cancelled or postponed because of Covid-19, we won\u2019t let it detour our wizardry! \r\n\r\nWhile in quarantine, we\u2019ve been heads down working on adding new features, governance tools and enhanced swag to hit the Ethereum circuit in full force in the coming years! \r\n\r\nUsing POAP we can:\r\n\r\nHost targeted airdrops to badge recipients of specific events\r\nUse badges as sentimental collateral for lending\r\nAllow badges to be used as proxy for special governance polls\r\nPartner with projects like Kickback for unique redemption schemas\r\nCrown the \u201cEthereum Vagabond\u201d based on the number of events attended\r\n\r\nThe possibilities are truly endless and we plan on using our Gitcoin Grant funding to help expand our ecosystem awareness and build out a suite of killer features to take the project to the next level.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve ever gotten some POAP swag and want to express your appreciation, this is your chance! \r\n\r\nAny amount you donate (one time or recurring) is very welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nPOAP Socials:\r\n\r\nTwitter (http://twitter.com/poapxyz)\r\nTelegram (http://t.me/poapxyz)\r\nDiscord (http://poap.xyz/discord)\r\nGithub (http://github.com/poapxyz)\r\nWebsite (http://poap.xyz)\r\nReddit (http://reddit.com/r/poap)\r\nMedium (https://medium.com/@poap)", "last_update": "2020-09-19T16:50:37Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 4\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-0.9752", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/poapxyz", "handle": "poapxyz", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/00ad8d0e061831e45dbbfe5b8d9429da/poapxyz.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 7111.41294928936, 0.0], [1.0, 7217.47843929094, 106.065490001572], [10.0, 7302.97396834394, 191.56101905458], [100.0, 7380.37591944885, 268.962970159488], [1000.0, 7424.6465769477, 313.23362765834], [10000.0, 7442.9230056919, 331.510056402533]], "last_clr_calc_date": "8\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "11\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "2502.7928", "positive_round_contributor_count": 121, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.4590", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "poap-proof-of-attendance-protocol", "url": "/grants/490/poap-proof-of-attendance-protocol", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0x7FeA517B79d5DDF53A2e2E5c2990155E1CFEc21E", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x20D08E58952bb70ff0EC1271085cA969C14BE2a3", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1139, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/cec4264e672c851ccbe9c50093bb42b4/chili_passport.png", "details_url": "/grants/1139/metacartel-builder-awards-panvala-league", "title": "MetaCartel Builder Awards (Panvala League) \ud83d\udee1", "description": "MetaCartel is a member of the Panvala League: we stake PAN tokens to earn matching for donations made using PAN.

Currently focused on the Ethereum protocol, ETH2.0, yEarn, and UMA. \n\nEthereum captured the imagination because it's neutral. We build on it without fear of discrimination, censorship, or undue rent. We need to extend this property beyond the base protocol, by building auto-pilot rent-free public financial utilities that we use and build on under the same neutrality and fairness assurances. This is generally the guiding principle behind my work. \n\nHighlights of some of my contributions so far:\n\nOngoing Work to Found an Auditing Academy: \nThere has been an overwhelming positive response to this proposal. I am currently working on an incentive structure to take this proposal to the next level: on-chain vote, budget allocation, before operations begin. The Gitcoin team has been working on a similar idea, and we're currently discussing how we can merge our efforts to make the Academy a self-sustaining and potentially profitable public good for the whole ecosystem.\n\nGovernance-free access to credit via in-protocol tokenization of gas: \nThis is the first in a series of research posts aimed at creating a market-based solution to the gas price volatility. As a side benefit, it also enables a public option for essential financial utilities like access to credit.\n\nETH2 development: \nAn optimal algorithm to tally up validator attestations. I will be implementing it in Trinity first, then Go for Prysm client.\n\nGASETH price feed on UMA to facilitate gas options/futures products as an alternative to gas mining: \nCurrently gas mining is used as a proxy to hedge against gas price volatility. But it ends up contributing to congestion itself. This represents an externalized cost on other users of the network. I am working on this PR with UMA in order to lay the ground work for futures/options product that can facilitate sustainable ways of hedging gas costs. Once the PR is accepted, I will also build a tool for DVM governers to simplify reporting this feed.\n\nRent-free stablecoin AMM on yEarn: \nStablecoin exchange is one of the most widely used services on Ethereum. This proposal advocates for rent-free and governance-minimized stablecoin-optimized AMM. There is an overwhelming community support for this, and work on it is ongoing.\n\nyEarn strategy for ETH and YFI long-term holders\nThis strategy is intended for those long both assets. The initial response has been positive. Currently doing simulation and backtesting to compare this strategy against simply hodling both assets.\n\nArticles for the general public: \nPeriodical articles for the general public to unpack technical topics. The next article is about a framework for understanding and evaluating layer-2 solutions.\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-25T04:35:27.363Z", "last_update_natural": "6\u00a0days, 9\u00a0hours ago", "sybil_score": "-0.3014", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "INFRA TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/aliatiia", "handle": "aliatiia", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/2c910bfa0273ecde9536195e18558519/aliatiia.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 3456.46430144451, 0.0], [1.0, 3568.52533303206, 112.061031587542], [10.0, 3646.1363485137, 189.672047069185], [100.0, 3710.94008890018, 254.47578745567], [1000.0, 3746.35303624906, 289.888734804541], [10000.0, 3760.68374231177, 304.21944086726]], "last_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "15\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "3223.4798", "positive_round_contributor_count": 73, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "rd-in-rent-free-public-financial-utilities", "url": "/grants/1211/rd-in-rent-free-public-financial-utilities", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x0A0b368C0F1644fa269F0d6377232906747754A3", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1069, "logo_url": "https://s.gitcoin.co/static/v2/images/grants/logos/1.bbfe934a7079.png", "details_url": "/grants/1069/feel-the-yearn", "title": "Feel the yearn", "description": "Dashboards for monitoring the Yearn protocol\n", "last_update": "2020-08-18T19:48:33.631Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0month, 1\u00a0week ago", "sybil_score": "0.0741", "weighted_risk_score": "0.1782", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/graham-u", "handle": "graham-u", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/54d76b9d284956a597ba6abe953b814f/grahamutton.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 1063.32175489697, 0.0], [1.0, 1112.96880668967, 49.6470517926937], [10.0, 1152.76078143898, 89.439026542005], [100.0, 1188.77028110311, 125.448526206134], [1000.0, 1209.30294257493, 145.981187677954], [10000.0, 1217.76376580412, 154.442010907148]], "last_clr_calc_date": "23\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "1766.4601", "positive_round_contributor_count": 54, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "feel-the-yearn", "url": "/grants/1069/feel-the-yearn", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xBb400a040606e61E46F3aAEe2fe3Ea1daB5FDeAD", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1110, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/4b7f50325c5b8f5e29d055e3c8f44213/Minerva_Logo_Vertical_RGB_Colour_470x450-2x.png", "details_url": "/grants/1110/minerva-digital-wallet", "title": "Minerva - Digital Wallet", "description": "Minerva\u00a0is a user friendly, open-source, digital wallet for self-sovereign identities and moneys.\u00a0\n\nTL;DR (regular user): Minerva is like your physical wallet and simplifies everything around your identities, moneys and automated services offered by other applications. After the initial setup, which is done in less than a minute, you can start a life free from middlemen which provide no additional value. Most of the time Minerva will just work in the background and inform you about what happened via notifications, saving your valuable time for more important things.\u00a0\n\nTL;DR (tech nerd): Minerva safely stores multiple\u00a0DIDs,\u00a0Verifiable Credentials\u00a0and coins / tokens on various\u00a0EVM\u00a0networks via\u00a0EOAs\u00a0and\u00a0Gnosis Safe contract accounts\u00a0and documents all interactions. What makes Minerva unique is its\u00a0'Multi-Account-Multi-Network' privacy enabling user interface. Minerva beta supports several test networks and is going to support the following networks once released:\u00a0Ethereum mainnet,\u00a0xDai STAKE,\u00a0POA Core,\u00a0IDChain,\u00a0ARTIS \u03a31\u00a0and\u00a0DMD Diamond v4. DApp interaction will be enabled via\u00a0WalletConnect, so that your Minerva wallet can tap into the Open Finance (aka DeFi) world.\u00a0\n\nMinerva is like your physical wallet and therefore much more than a traditional crypto wallet, able to effortlessly and safely interact with other applications, providing everything needed in a decentralized fashion.\u00a0We design the Minerva wallet specifically for real-life use cases on private markets, governments and commons (see\u00a0Commons Stack), where decentralized identities and tokens will play a much greater role in the near future. Human-centricity, GDPR compliance and privacy-by-design are the design goals we pursue and the users have always full control over their keys, data and money.\u00a0The unique 'Multi-Account-Multi-Network' user interface simplifies keeping addresses private and avoiding all sorts of linkages between your accounts. Create a new account on any supported network with just 3 clicks in less than 5 seconds. No switching between networks in the settings, no restart of the app, no new wallet - all accounts on one 'Values' screen.\u00a0\n\nYou like the idea?\nJoin the test program at:\u00a0https://android-preview.minerva.digital/\u00a0or just download the latest .apk to your Android phone at:\u00a0https://dev.lab10.io/apks/Minerva-staging.apk\n\nNext Activities (within that grant)\n\nEnable Main-Networks\nAt the moment, several test networks are available in Minerva: Ethereum Rinkeby, Ethereum Ropsten,\u00a0ARTIS \u03c41,\u00a0LUKSO L14\u00a0and\u00a0POA Sokol. With additional funds we want to add support for several main networks: Ethereum mainnet,\u00a0xDai STAKE,\u00a0POA Core,\u00a0IDChain\u00a0and\u00a0ARTIS \u03a31. We also want to support\u00a0DMD Diamond v4\u00a0as soon as they have migrated to their upcoming new EVM chain.\nThe major issue we have to solve now is reliable and cheap gas management for transactions to the highly volatile Ethereum mainnet. For this we will evaluate various options, ranging from the classic gas price oracle approach to relaying services for Gnosis Safe contract accounts - e.g. via\u00a0any.sender.\n\nIntegrate WalletConnect \nAn important step for the Minerva wallet is the support of WalletConnect, opening it up towards DApps in the DeFi space. We already have integrated Blocknative in one of our current Proof-of-Concept projects. This turned out to be such a usability 'quantum-leap' compared to the standard Metamask procedure, that we can't really imagine how we could do without so far. \n\n\nOutlook (likely beyond this grant)\n\nIntegrate TokenBridge / OmniBridge (Ethereum <--> xDai STAKE)\nPOA Network is working on an improved version for the TokenBridge between Ethereum and xDai STAKE to allow the transfer of ANY ERC20/ERC677/ERC827 token, between these chains. As a validator of xDai STAKE we are of course huge fans of this fast, low transaction fee, network, while DeFi is causing crazy Gas Prizes on Ethereum. Therefore we want to make it simple for Minerva wallet users to transfer their tokens to xDai STAKE and participate in the emerging DeFi (e.g. Uniswap by 1Hive) and DAO ecosystem there. \n\nDecentralized Identity Management\nThe quest to have a decentralized 'unique-human' ID is lead by\u00a0BrightID, which we would like to integrate into the Minerva wallet's identity management. Having this would unlock many use cases relying on this kind of sybil resistance, e.g.\u00a0for Gitcoin Grants itself. This could be either a full integration of the system or an integration through a Verifiable Credential (sometimes called claims, as BrightID puts it) - possibly combined with\u00a0ZKP's\u00a0for better privacy.\nAnother approach to achieve sybil resistance is shown by the\u00a0Circles\u00a0project which allows building of a trust graph based on the acceptance of money issued by network participants. We will closely monitor this project - expected to launch soon - in order to figure out how the resulting trust graph could be leveraged for more use cases.\nIn the current development cycle, we have already laid the groundwork for a contact list in the Minerva wallet, which should help with the implementation of projects like BrightID.\n\n'Private' & Public Accounts\nIn a recent\u00a0feature from Ryan Sean Adams\u00a0he highlighted how to keep funds kind of 'private' (nobody knows it's your account), to avoid that they are associated to someone and to avoid exposing all holdings and activities, despite being on a public network. We agree with\u00a0Zooko\u00a0and his talk at DEVCON4 that it's good if not everyone can see everyone's wealth and risk facing a\u00a05$ wrench attack\u00a0because of that.\nAs a possible solution we think of introducing a clear separation of accounts which are considered semi-private (nobody knows they are yours) and public accounts, where you don't have to be careful when transacting or have them publicly exposed.\u00a0\nThe Minerva wallet should support the user in creating semi-private accounts via\u00a0Tornado.cash\u00a0and warn about attempted transactions which would violate this separation.\nWe believe this could be a very useful feature and would be happy to get your opinion about this approach.\n\nFiat-Crypto On-Boarding\nGetting started in the crypto space is often about converting Fiat money to some kind of crypto asset. While this tends to become easier every year, it still poses a significant trust and usability hurdle for many, involving the interaction with often not-so-well-known entities (Exchanges) of questionable trustworthiness, exposure of personal information (passport details) for\u00a0KYC\u00a0in a sometimes cumbersome process, etc.\nWe therefore look for services like\u00a0Ramp\u00a0to simplify the process of purchasing crypto on different chains and keep them non-custodial in their wallet.\n\nSimplify Backup & Recovery\nThe benchmark for a simplified wallet recovery for us is Argent, but there's always tradeoffs, e.g. in terms of complexity. \nMost wallets (e.g. Trust Wallet) still use the simple and robust method of requiring the user to remember a seed phrase (mostly 12 words). In Minerva wallet, we currently also employ this concept. In order to maximize usability, this seed phrase alone is all the user needs to remember for a full recovery of a Minerva wallet, including all accounts, identities, history etc. This is achieved with a combination of HD key derivation (not only for accounts, but also for identities/DIDs) and additional metadata which is stored in the cloud in encrypted form. \nWhile writing down a seed phrase is simple, for most people the full reliance on proper handling of such a secret - without any fallback (recovery through \"lost password\") - is a non-trivial and often scary requirement. We thus want to add a guardian system with the possibility of social recovery as soon as possible. \n", "last_update": "2020-09-26T18:12:27.409Z", "last_update_natural": "4\u00a0days, 19\u00a0hours ago", "sybil_score": "-0.7778", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "INFRA TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/tze42", "handle": "tze42", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/50b5908e14d216a703e260841e9a6e63/tze42.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 1014.56007603423, 0.0], [1.0, 1064.7004415143, 50.1403654800704], [10.0, 1095.66813884187, 81.1080628076475], [100.0, 1119.2138862852, 104.653810250973], [1000.0, 1131.06031724328, 116.500241209057], [10000.0, 1135.62234143841, 121.062265404188]], "last_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "15\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "493.3126", "positive_round_contributor_count": 27, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "minerva-digital-wallet", "url": "/grants/1110/minerva-digital-wallet", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x9fC13b4E1C4206970a1C4520d2f77336CD5D0e0a", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 274, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/775cdffd7ce9fe1cfad231eaf2641c6b/Abridged_Logo_Transparent.png", "details_url": "/grants/274/abridged", "title": "Abridged", "description": "Abridged in 2020\n\nAbridged continues to walk down the path of creating delightful web3 experiences with the ability to onboard *anyone* to receive value from crypto. \n\nRecently, we created Collab.Land.

"/grants/285/democracy-earth-foundation", "title": "Democracy Earth Foundation", "description": "Solving the Double-Human Problem on Ethereum with a Probabilistic Proof of Personhood score.\n\nThe current state of large-scale political economies on Ethereum - as for example MakerDAO - is dominated by plutocracies, or \u201crule by the wealthy\u201d. In turn, more democratic systems - such as Gitcoin Grants or MolochDAOs - rely on identity management by central verifiers or local trust. At Democracy Earth, we believe that Ethereum can go beyond that. Ethereum may facilitate universal democracy, \u201crule by the people\u201d - not by one person or a group of people, rule by all people.\n\nBased on this vision, Equality Protocol aims to formalize people on Ethereum. It is the fundamental building block for democratic Ethereum applications. Any Ethereum account can call Equality\u2019s functions to calculate the so-called Equality score for any one Ethereum account. This is a probabilistic score between -1.00 and 1.00 that indicates the personhood of an Ethereum account. Higher Equality scores signal that an account is the unique social Ethereum account of one person. The scores for an account are derived from its memberships in DAOs on Ethereum, in particular from specific subjective and objective properties of these DAOs.\n\nWhile Equality scores constitute the \u201cpeople\u201d on Ethereum, Equality applications are the spaces where democratic rule-making happens. Just to name a few possibilities, consider applications for borderless, censorship-resistant elections, basic incomes, or quadratic funding programs. Every human has equal rights to the social benefits of Equality applications. The social and multidimensional nature of Equality scores makes Sybil attacks of Equality applications super expensive, even given significant advances in machine intelligence.\n\nCheck out the whitepaper to find out more about the underlying economics and values of Equality Protocol.\n\n\nOther Proof-Of-Personhood Approaches\n\nTogether with RadicalxChange Foundation and Perm State University, Democracy Earth has published a research paper on the state of the art of decentralized identity protocols in August 2020. Read it here: \u201cWho Watches the Watchmen? A Review of Subjective Approaches for Sybil-resistance in Proof of Personhood Protocols.\u201d\n\n\nSupporters and Partners\n\nYCombinator is a seed money startup accelerator that helped launch over 2,000 companies, including Stripe, Airbnb, Cruise Automation, DoorDash, Coinbase, Instacart, Dropbox, Twitch, and Reddit. Democracy Earth Foundation was started at YCombinator in January 2015 where it received a USD 100k seed grant.\n\nRadicalxChange Foundation is a nonprofit for next-generation political economies. Together with RadicalxChange Foundation, Democracy Earth Foundation implemented the first official Quadratic Voting application for a United States government in Colorado State House of Representatives in April 2019.\n\nTempleton World Charity Foundation is a nonprofit transforming lives across the world. In August 2019, Democracy Earth received a USD 228k grant from the Templeton World Charity Foundation in order to continue developing the efforts on machine learning resistant proofs of personhood.\n\n\nMomentum and Objectives\n\nPresent\n\nMechanism design side of Equality Protocol is finished and laid out in the whitepaper\nDAO Explorer is up and running\n\nQ4 2020\n\nDevelop and summon Equality DAO onboarding and engaging members to vote\nCalculate and write Equality scores on Ethereum mainnet and providing an Personhood Probabilistic Score oracle service.\u00a0\nInitiate relationships with developers of Equality applications - advocacy and technical documentation\n\nQ1 - Q2 2021\nPartner with developers of Equality applications; co-engineering and channeling feedback into protocol development and documentation\u00a0\nDevelop Equality application for universal basic income with Democracy Earth token\nOrganize hackathon for Equality projects\n\n\nAbout Democracy Earth Foundation\n\nDemocracy Earth Foundation is a non-profit  non-profit building open source & censorship resistant democracies that can be deployed anywhere where there's an internet connection. \n\nFounded in 2015, the Foundation is backed by Templeton World Charity Foundation, Y Combinator, Fast Forward, Shuttleworth Foundation and winner of the 2016 Global Grand Challenge of Singularity University and the 2017 MIT Technology Review 35 Under 35 award.\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-15T07:21:20.361Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks, 2\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-1.0122", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/santisiri", "handle": "santisiri", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/e39e442b3402f75505d22f41920cc8f3/santisiri.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 3007.50208775582, 0.0], [1.0, 3082.6970492278, 75.1949614719852], [10.0, 3144.4948830205, 136.992795264685], [100.0, 3198.06894034449, 190.566852588676], [1000.0, 3227.46660282112, 219.964515065307], [10000.0, 3239.32201142411, 231.819923668288]], "last_clr_calc_date": "3\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "16\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "681.5302", "positive_round_contributor_count": 82, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "50.4990", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "democracy-earth-foundation", "url": "/grants/285/democracy-earth-foundation", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0xE933348E41abF43b626Ba595B6c3F3318fAb038C", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x396e0dcd35A534975BfF6bF044AC0E373A29D231", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 139, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/4d25e093b922eba34324d98b2a0713e1/Facebook_post.png", "details_url": "/grants/139/defiprimecom", "title": "defiprime.com", "description": "Defiprime.com is a digital media and analytical services provider for the DeFi community.

We can\u2019t edit the previous website link of the grant. \nKindly check out our project. We are still new and developing that\u2019s why we need your contribution to bring this project to a better stage.\n\nThe Organic-Block is a decentralized urban agricultural platform where people could rent vacant spaces such as backyards, rooftops or basements to produce crops using vertical farming methods. Our application incentives the urban population to farm by giving them a designated marketplace to sell their new product to consumers in their areas. We also provide our low-cost modern IoT equipment and service for vertical farming techniques.\nWe are very focused on the impact factor and our product meets the following UN Development Goals:\n\nUN Sustainable Development Goals\nGoal 2: End Hunger\n Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities\n Goal 15: Reduction in forest loss and land degradation\n Goal 13: Climate Action\n Goal 12: Sustainable production pattern\n\nWe analyzed a lot of issues regarding renting guidelines and also the authenticity of crops. As the crops in the market place are grown through our platform, this can ensure the authenticity of every product with the help of the underlying Blockchain Architecture. Also, crypto-based payments can potentially give profits for both parties. Our project is an android application and the web interface is made of Vue.js. We have built our Blockchain Architecture over Fortmatics Plasma Framework. The documentation is encrypted by using the Blockstack Encryption framework. This was primarily to scale our applications for the Indian markets and traffic. We also integrated crypto-based payments from Metamask.\n\nFeatures\nA peer-to-peer infrastructure which connects owner to the renter.\nA fully decentralized architecture backed by our Blockchain Network.\nAn inbuilt market place to incentivize the urban population into farming.\nAuthenticity reassured using our public Blockchain Network.\n\n Our Vision\nThe vision of Organic Block is to incorporate technologies such as the automated artificial environment for plant growth. This can give a complete analysis of the farm conditions to the owner and buyer. Also improving the IoT hardware to make it comparable with multiple types of lands and climate. We plan to start a venture by designing our prototype into an end product with a much better and interactive UI, app under-development.\n \nOur Accomplishment\nWe have made an end to end functional application for the project and also a web interface. We also integrated the crypto payments mechanism and we used IPFS for our decentralized storage mechanism.\n\nYou can support this grant so that we can continue to improve this project. We need the funding because we don't have access to any other fundraising at the moment and we believe that any fund we receive from this grant will propel our project to another milestone.

It's a cross-disciplinary field that draws from established practices in engineering and related disciplines such as Behavioral & Ecological Economics, Operations Research, AI & Optimization. The Token Engineering Community has been active since 2018, conducting meetups and workshops, collecting and digesting relevant research in the sector, and offering a platform to collaborate.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udee0 HOW WE'LL USE THE FUNDS \n\nOffer scholarships and cover course fees for talented students \nRefine existing education program, offer great facilitation, mentoring and feedback\nOpen-source and distribute canvases and tools, e.g. at the \"Hitchhikers Guide to TokenEngineering\" (https://gitcoin.co/grants/798/a-hitchhikers-guide-to-token-engineering)\nDevelop new content and scout for the best trainers - on top of our to-do list are Cryptoeconomic Patterns and Simulations/cadCAD!\nEducation is not a zero-sum game: the vision for TE Academy is to provide a platform for knowledge creation, managed in a decentralized fashion, to curate high-quality content and reward course creators, teachers, alumni and students according to knowledge dissemination and impact, which are important for any token project out there. #BeSafe\n\n\n\n\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-28T09:32:19.479Z", "last_update_natural": "3\u00a0days, 4\u00a0hours ago", "sybil_score": "-1.0541", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/angelakte", "handle": "angelakte", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/ac402adbeaf926ca3bb331590c9c9f8e/angelakte.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 1049.6657226206, 0.0], [1.0, 1100.08911468168, 50.4233920610761], [10.0, 1139.62408108384, 89.9583584632369], [100.0, 1176.18580276065, 126.520080140044], [1000.0, 1197.7849626808, 148.119240060199], [10000.0, 1206.88706805019, 157.22134542959]], "last_clr_calc_date": "8\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "11\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "602.8872", "positive_round_contributor_count": 37, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "30.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "tokenengineering-academy-education-for-web3-crypt", "url": "/grants/517/tokenengineering-academy-education-for-web3-crypt", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0xb05ed90d629b650414ba41be973769b60e8d1143", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x3b067Af83F540cB827825a6Ee5480441a4237E77", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1240, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/077307bde9cb333bc5cbcd1cbfc624ed/a2c9baf2afdf42c281d803adb91432dc.jpg", "details_url": "/grants/1240/trickle-your-hourly-pay-cryptographically-secured", "title": "Trickle - Your Hourly Pay, Cryptographically Secured", "description": "The internet era brought a lot of new good things as well as real challenges. Esports, decentralized communities, freelance, whatever. Making a monetary agreement over the internet is a common practice today, however, there are more and more cases when people are fooled and are just not getting paid.\n\nTrickle is a complete application that allows people to create hourly-rate-driven contracts between multiple parties in any ERC20-compatible tokens or stablecoins. It implements the most transparent monetary relationships between the customer and contractors (employer/employees, teams/players and so on).\n\nFrom the contractor's side, the agreement is 100% safe as tokens accrued to their balance are permanent. If the employer decides to cancel the agreement, the contractor just stops providing services, without losing a thing.\nFrom the employer's side, the employer doesn't lose too much when they get a bad contractor. It's the employer's responsibility to check how well the contractor is doing. And they can cancel the agreement at any time for a reason.\n\nFor example, when you are a contractor with an hourly rate of $20, you can withdraw your funds at any time: $1 after 3 minutes, or $10 after half of an hour, or $200 after 10 hours. Before the agreement is established, the employer determines the period of an agreement, and the tokens are locked on the smart contract. Later, the smart contract releases tokens to the employee according to their hourly rate.\n\nHowever, both the sender and the recipient have the ability to terminate the agreement. The\u00a0key point\u00a0is that in the case of agreement termination, the recipient receives tokens/stablecoins that have accrued on their balance up until the termination date, according to their fixed-hourly rate. Thus:\nFrom the recipient\u2019s side, they are secure because blockchain guarantees they will receive the tokens/stablecoins which have accrued to date. In the case the sender spontaneously decides to terminate the agreement, the recipient just stops providing services with no losses.\nFrom the sender\u2019s side, they don\u2019t have the risk of paying a dishonest recipient; it\u2019s the sender\u2019s (employer\u2019s) responsibility to check how well the recipient (employee) performs, and in case of a bad performance, the agreement can be terminated at any point.\n\nThese two points are crucial.

Since we charge no fees to our users, this will enable us to keep building engaging, habit forming applications which blend gamification and DeFi.\n\n\nHistory\nGoodGhosting was born out of\u00a0ETH London, and part of the fabulous Gitcoin KERNEL program.

We are pleased to say this vision is now quickly becoming reality!\n\nHow does it work?\nThe gameplay of GoodGhosting is super simple. \nA player joins a saving pool. By making regular payments (e.g. weekly or monthly), a player stays in the game, while his assets earn interest. At the end of the game, the earned interest is split amongst all winning players. If a player misses a payment, he looses, but still gets his principle back.\n\nIn depth:\nYou choose how long and how much you would like to save, and are matched with other players with similar goals. Multiple players are added to the same savings pool, which runs for a fixed timeframe.\nYou make regular payments in either DAI or USDC (or other assets)during a fixed duration. The funds get added to the savings pool, \nYou watch intrest accrue in the savings pool\nAt the end of the game,\u00a0the players that met all of their regular payments win.\nEveryone will get their principal amount back. However, only the regular savers, aka \u2018the winners\u2019, will get a slice of the interest generated \u2014 gaining them\u00a0higher interest than if they saved solo\u00a0\ud83d\udd25\n\n\nWhy GoodGhosting?\nIf you are wondering about the name, it\u2019s GoodGhosting because the more users ghost (i.e. drop out of the game \ud83d\udc7b), the better the returns for the winners. Ghosting others (i.e. miss a payment) means you lose the right to earn interest on your principal. Hence, players who do not ghost, get other users' interest and earn a higher APY.\n\nWhich DeFi platforms are we using? \nUser funds are deposited into Aave (and soon also Yearn.Finance) to generate attractive interest rates. And avantage of pooling funds of multiple users, is that we can save on gas costs.\n\nFor more info, check out our FAQ or Medium post.\n\nTeam\n\n\n\nSom of our team members that took part in the KERNEL program. Two additional devs are working on it behind the scenes.\n\n\nRoadmap\nAfter the recent launch of our Landing Page, we received valuable user feedback and we will continue to iterate the platform. Currently, we have a non-gas-optimized version of the game running on the Kovan testnet. We are now further optimizing the smart contracts and user interface. \n\n\nOur short-term goal is to have a gas-optimized version running on Kovan (i.e. testnet launch), which can be user-tested and thereafter ported to Ethereum mainnet or a compatible Layer 2 solution (i.e. mainnet launch). We understand that current gas prices are prohibitive for many users, and aim to keep transaction costs as low as possible.\n\nWe are also integrating:\nThe Graph for querying real-time and past game data\nan (optional) email notification system\na fiat on-ramp for easy onboarding\nhigher reward assets\nthe ability to DCA into crypto assets\n\n\n\nFunding\nSo far, we received a community grant from Aave \ud83d\udc7b which will be used to seed and incentivize our genesis pool, further increasing rewards for all users. We are very grateful to the Aave fam for enabling this!\nStill, to further develop the protocol we are looking for additional funds from within the community. \n\nSince all donations are on-chain, all contributors to this Gitcoin Grant might even receive an exclusive reward once the platform goes live! \ud83d\udc7b\n\nLinks \nCommunication\nDiscord \ud83d\udc48 Join our community to enter our genesis savings pool\nTwitter \ud83d\udc48 Keep up to date with the latest news!\nMedium (project updates)\nSubstack (project updates straight in your mailbox) \n\nProduct\nLanding page (mock up)\nEarly prototype (clickable)\nEarly KERNEL pitch\nRemember to join our community to take part in our genesis savings pool, which launches soon\u2122 \n", "last_update": "2020-09-10T13:12:32.617Z", "last_update_natural": "3\u00a0weeks ago", "sybil_score": "-0.5000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/deepcryptodive", "handle": "deepcryptodive", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/56afd3263d0e0dd0c6b38dc31ecf521e/deepcryptodive.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 2485.64635403446, 0.0], [1.0, 2548.45008582656, 62.803731792093], [10.0, 2596.38905596844, 110.742701933973], [100.0, 2638.94179804679, 153.29544401233], [1000.0, 2662.96129090314, 177.314936868674], [10000.0, 2672.79385521329, 187.147501178828]], "last_clr_calc_date": "24\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "3438.2275", "positive_round_contributor_count": 66, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "goodghosting-a-defi-savings-game", "url": "/grants/1112/goodghosting-a-defi-savings-game", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xee8f6ae101dD7048Dd8484EEaABbC1efD352eaAe", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1122, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/5b201ac0bbadac74ce98b01d0d3caacb/vyper-fun.png", "details_url": "/grants/1122/vyperfun-cryptozombiesethernaut-for-vyper", "title": "Vyper.fun | CryptoZombies+Ethernaut for Vyper", "description": "CryptoZombies+Ethernaut for Vyper.

Besides creating an enjoyable experience, we have 3 main goals we hope to accomplish with this work:\n\u00a0\n\t1. Show the crypto community the power of using modeling to optimize their token ecosystems, especially around governance design.\n\u00a0\n\t2. Show how Conviction Voting works to inspire more novel governance systems.\n\t\n\t3. Illustrate how Augmented Bonding Curves can be used to generate funding in a token economy. (Leap 2)\n\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\u00a0\nThe goal of the Commons Stack is to use robust token engineering practices to bring sustainable funding to public goods.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen people contribute to a public good (like donating to a Gitcoin grant, or developing open source projects) we believe they should be rewarded, and we have the designs for a toolkit to make it happen. The Commons Stack enables communities to create their own circular, purpose-driven economies that interface with the outside economy through a bonding curve that bootstraps the network and brings continuous funding to the desired cause.\u00a0\n\nIn short, we are designing circular economies that issue currency to fund public goods using DAOs and Bonding Curves. \n\u00a0\nTo ensure the long-term success of our goals and enable rapid innovation on our designs by the greater community, we have a heavy focus on modeling our systems in cadCAD before developing smart contracts.\n\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-17T16:08:28.604Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 6\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-1.2059", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/griffgreen", "handle": "griffgreen", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/6e1318f1c48037b6a5b8188527d2c742/griffgreen.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 466.593778318318, 0.0], [1.0, 497.973716704356, 31.3799383860388], [10.0, 522.639631830723, 56.0458535124054], [100.0, 545.18595346998, 78.5921751516619], [1000.0, 558.472243529881, 91.8784652115634], [10000.0, 564.08799056136, 97.4942122430428]], "last_clr_calc_date": "3\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "16\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "419.5834", "positive_round_contributor_count": 34, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "104.2717", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "commons-simulator-reverse-the-apocalypse-with-eco", "url": "/grants/277/commons-simulator-reverse-the-apocalypse-with-eco", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0x7a14dd4464052ab9985520c28d466e8c49be60ac", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xa0527bA80D811cd45d452481Caf902DFd6F5b8c2", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1086, "logo_url": "https://s.gitcoin.co/static/v2/images/grants/logos/0.d2d406570f42.png", "details_url": "/grants/1086/independent-ethvestigator-program", "title": "Independent Ethvestigator Program", "description": "This grant sponsors public researchers whose multidisciplinary work indirectly benefits Ethereum.

At the moment, we are specifically targeting regions where informal credit solutions have flourished due to the inability of institutional finance to serve their audience effectively, often due to either geographic distance or insufficient credit history.\n\nOur risk-underwriting model treats the reputation of a borrower as a proxy for their credit score, allowing us to gauge risk and price loans, even in the absence of a formal credit profile. At the core of our solution is the notion of `lines of trust', where trust is defined as the maximum that one is willing to allow another participant to borrow. Borrowers source loans from their direct trust lines, and lenders novate their loan exposure by negotiating lower interest-rate loans from their own trust lines in turn (which repeats as far as possible).\n\nOur product solves a common global problem - even within the United States, a majority of millennials do not have a formal credit score, and legislation such as the SAFE Act has had the unintended consequence of producing significant rejection rates for credit products amongst both millennials and Gen-Z.\n\nWorldwide, 1.8 billion people rely on their family and friends for credit, forced into an informal sector characterised by high interest rates and/or predatory practices, with no way for successful credit usage to be used as a basis for entry into the formal sector. Our product enables borrowers and lenders alike to interact with each other in the informal manner in which most of our users are accustomed to, but also produces a concrete history which can be used as the basis on which a formal credit score can be built.\n\nIntroductory video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMWjdX-ThMQ\n\nJoin our Discord!\n\n------\n\nProgress Since CLR Round 7 Started\n\nAfter the current round started, we were offered a place in the October cohort of the ConsenSys Labs Tachyon Accelerator (https://labs.consensys.net/tachyon/).\n\nUltimately, we chose to decline the invitation, as we're slightly further along in development than Tachyon's target audience, but would like to thank ConsenSys for the opportunity!\n\nIn addition, we've signed up another two companies - a plastic component manufacturer and a steel castings foundry - and received our first loan request, which we aim to have disbursed before the Gitcoin round ends.\n\nThings are finally moving - thank you all for the support!\n\n------\n\nDevelopment Progress Since CLR Round 6\n\nLet's start off with the really important stuff: we're live! As of two weeks ago, our beta MVP was launched within a solar energy company in Mumbai, India. Said company offers loan facilities to its' employees of up to two months salary, and had previously been offering these loans at zero percent interest. Due to the ongoing pandemic, they noticed that they were receiving a significant increase in simultaneous applications for loans, and could not meet them all. We've stepped in with our own funding pool, and opened up the possibility for fellow employees within the company to add their own funds to the pool in order to receive between 10-20% APR on utilised funds. We'll be sure to provide updates on how this MVP progresses.\n\nMore widely, we have another dozen or so companies who have volunteered to pilot our product with their own employees, with headcounts ranging from 50 to upwards of 6,000. This allows us ample opportunity to a) increase our active user base, b) A/B test network parameters, and c) iterate features that are still in development whilst still gathering data from pilots running in parallel. During the roll-out of these additional pilots, we will introduce our pricing model (i.e. initial setup fee, small fees on loan principals disbursed and lender portfolios managed), with the aim of the most cost-effective credit solution within the market.\n\nYou can view a demo of our product dashboard by visiting https://app.arboreum.dev/demo - right now, usage of this dashboard is constrained to registered users within our pilots, but it doesn't hurt to be able to look! :)\n\n------\n\nModel Pivot Since CLR Round 6\n\nIn the time since the last Gitcoin round, we have pivoted towards a simpler lending model (with a single lending pool, and the option for people to act as \u2018supporters\u2019 for a loan application), and focused on adoption by companies rather than on a user-by-user basis.\n\nThe reason for our pivot is that we were finding it difficult to convey the idea of repeatedly novating (taking on intermediate loans at less expensive terms to offset loan exposure) amongst network participants to potential users, despite it being a net benefit for all involved. As such, we\u2019ve retained the core notion of loans being funded by networks, but temporarily dropped the notion of indirect lenders, and introduced the concept of supporters - first-loss-bearing co-lenders who do not put the balance of a loan in escrow. The degree to which these supporters offer to fund a loan directly impacts the interest rate that a borrower receives for the remaining principal (funded by the pool). In exchange for their higher exposure, these supporters receive a higher interest rate than that received by lenders comprising said pool.\n\nOur reason for the focus change in adoption is that many companies in India already offer an \u2018emergency loan\u2019 service to their employees where - for example - they can borrow up to twice their monthly salary. Given the pandemic (and the increase in employees simultaneously applying for these loans), we found that we received a great deal more traction by offering the ability to place the funding pool in the hands of employees (akin to a credit union), offering them an additional instrument for investing their funds in a safe environment, and reducing the financial pressure on companies.\n\nWe realised that focusing on deploying on this basis - at this stage of our growth - makes more sense than searching for/onboarding users from disparate locations: companies come pre-equipped with their own social networks, and employees of companies that offer these emergency loan services would likely be onboarded as part of the migration from the company-owned service to the employee-owned one. In our current model, supporters must be employees of the same company as the borrower, and risk is reduced by the fact that part of the loan principal is collateralised by the salary of the borrower (as, in the event of default, it is far easier to route funds from a defaulted borrower to their lenders when working within the same payroll system).\n\nWe're excited to have you join us.\n", "last_update": "2020-09-27T10:13:39.419Z", "last_update_natural": "4\u00a0days, 3\u00a0hours ago", "sybil_score": "0.9348", "weighted_risk_score": "34.1734", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/arboreum-github", "handle": "arboreum-github", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/e22ab9bc468ae08d564d3b4db83611a9/arboreum-github.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 1586.54498699139, 0.0], [1.0, 1636.23393324509, 49.6889462537015], [10.0, 1669.77390668889, 83.228919697498], [100.0, 1696.39937817619, 109.854391184797], [1000.0, 1710.26376431426, 123.71877732287], [10000.0, 1715.70349944677, 129.158512455382]], "last_clr_calc_date": "12\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "7\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "1044.6178", "positive_round_contributor_count": 46, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "arboreum", "url": "/grants/618/arboreum", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0xF2296CF3b5B6D1Da2190940abA15e8Cf40CEB3F2", "token_symbol": "DAI", "admin_address": "0xB632c8E5f87A47A0cAEb613cBDF0F748217d2840", "token_address": "0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1151, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/489f81f65eae892ce5b0b5cc269f3b4a/ethereumfuzzing.jpg", "details_url": "/grants/1151/fuzzing-home-helping-find-bugs-in-eth-20-clients", "title": "Fuzzing @ Home - helping find bugs in ETH 2.0 clients", "description": "Hi all,\n\ni've been an Etherean since nov 2016, and i recently decided to throw my hat in the ring and take a more proactive role, helping ensure a successful transition to eth2.0.\nI work in IT and when i stumbled upon BeaconFuzz, the amazing fuzzing tool developed by the Sigma Prime guys, a community run Fuzzing framework targeting various eth2.0 clients i knew i had to give it a try.\nThis initiative aims to harness computational resources(CPU cycles mainly) from participants in the quest to find potential bugs and security vulnerabilities in the various eth2.0 clients in order to harden the network and make the entire project more resilient to attacks. They recently updated the tool to be able to detect discrepancies between clients that could manifest as consensus issues(structural differential fuzzing),this will greatly reduce the risk of consensus bugs affecting phase 0 mainnet.\n\nThe tool is not exceedingly hard to use but it is very resource intensive and needs to be run 24/7 to have a decent coverage and be of any real benefit.To this end i have been fuzzing on a remote VPS with 8 cores/8GB ram and on an Odroid H2+, small SBC(single board computer) that i acquired specifically for this purpose.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/W62wtqc\n\nSo far i have managed to uncover and report 3 bugs that have been confirmed: \nOverflow/underflow in ProposerSlashing processing\nFailed val->IsArrayBufferView assertion when parsing invalid ENR string \ncrash-2cf82c9a6bf1e6e9e0609d767f4ea582defd9cf3 in proposer_slashing \nand one that is pending confirmation : \ncrash-04bf9c907f05466a1bf0d9f203f30dacb2f19703 in attestation\n\nApart from the above bugs i also reported some minor miscellaneous issues in the fuzzer itself.\n\nI will be fuzzing 24/7 until phase 0 mainnet and hopefully if the EF sees value in the project and Sigma Prime keeps maintaining it i will be dedicating time and resources to it in perpetuity.\n\nI plan to build a small cluster of passively cooled Odroid H2+ boards to aid in the fuzzing effort as they are low cost and have a small power envelope and physical footprint that is well suited to be run at scale in a home environment (i'm also evaluating the GMK NucBox and the Asus PN50 4800U).\n\nI'm only doing this because i love Ethereum and its community and will keep at it regardless, nonetheless any tips to recoup hardware/electricity expenses and time invested are very much appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\n\ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc1b\n\n\nDaft-Wullie\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-29T11:03:52.832Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0days, 2\u00a0hours ago", "sybil_score": "-0.3429", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/daft-wullie", "handle": "daft-wullie", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/e30deb43d53f5f7843de87b506f1bad2/daft-wullie.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 801.108035067995, 0.0], [1.0, 840.395050129066, 39.2870150610711], [10.0, 864.688278476327, 63.5802434083315], [100.0, 885.139104881962, 84.031069813967], [1000.0, 896.793589728653, 95.6855546606575], [10000.0, 901.693650456572, 100.585615388576]], "last_clr_calc_date": "25\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "2126.0390", "positive_round_contributor_count": 35, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "fuzzing-home-helping-find-bugs-in-eth-20-clients", "url": "/grants/1151/fuzzing-home-helping-find-bugs-in-eth-20-clients", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xD6dB4Be0b1c33987DC01cBF113B5f07c0232a07a", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 811, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/956133d93046f6f496b30648d8f5e2e5/logo-black.png", "details_url": "/grants/811/tokenbrice-shining-light-on-ethereums-defi-en-fr", "title": "TokenBrice: Shining light on Ethereum's DeFi (EN & FR)", "description": "Through my professional and personal life, I am involved in many projects aiming to grow and develop Ethereum & the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nDuring the last round, I've used GitCoin to support projects positively contributing to the community.

Our monthly episode covers news, innovation, developments & projects in the Ethereum ecosystem. \n\nProblem \ud83d\udd12 \nThe Ethereum ecosystem moves fast. This is (mostly) a good thing. But for educators like myself, this speed makes it hard to keep my audience up to scratch on the latest from the Ethereum space.\n\nSolution \ud83d\udd10 \nIn February, Anthony Sassano and I started a monthly Ethereum update series. (As a video on the Nugget's News YouTube channel and an episode of the Nugget's News Crypto & Finance Podcast.)\n\nWhy support our monthly Ethereum update series via Gitcoin Grants? \ud83e\udd14\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Keep the public informed. We all know Ethereum is changing rapidly. So it's crucial that the public are able to access information on Ethereum that\u2019s accurate and up to date. With enough funds I would love to employ more staff.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Help Ethereum reach audiences outside the crypto bubble. Nugget\u2019s News lives and breathes crypto. But we also cover macroeconomics and other asset classes. By showcasing the latest from Ethereum every month, we believe that many who aren\u2019t aware of Ethereum\u2019s potential will seek to learn more.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Save yourself hours of reading. These days, keeping abreast of Ethereum ecosystem developments is a full-time gig. Doing this requires a lot of reading, too. We need more ways to stay up to date on Ethereum.\n\nRecapping Gitcoin Grants Rounds 5\u20136 \ud83d\udd19\n\nWe'd like to thank all who contributed to our grant during the 5th and 6th rounds of Gitcoin Grants. In particular, thank you to Marketing DAO for selecting Nugget's News as one of the 10 projects to contribute towards in the 5th round.\n\nPast Community Updates \ud83d\uddc2\n\nFebruary: YouTube / Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts / PodBean / LBRY\nMarch: YouTube / Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts / PodBean / LBRY\nApril: YouTube / Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts / PodBean / LBRY\nMay: YouTube / Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts / PodBean / LBRY\nJune: YouTube / Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts / PodBean / LBRY\nJuly: YouTube / Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts / PodBean / LBRY\nAugust: YouTube / Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts / PodBean / LBRY\n", "last_update": "2020-10-01T13:22:28.081Z", "last_update_natural": "34\u00a0minutes ago", "sybil_score": "0.7826", "weighted_risk_score": "11.9801", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/alex-nugget", "handle": "alex-nugget", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/70c4a83eb227ae3af15cb4315fbadfb1/alex-nugget.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 397.403981500199, 0.0], [1.0, 429.278991727734, 31.8750102275345], [10.0, 454.305766935836, 56.9017854356367], [100.0, 477.350601235371, 79.9466197351716], [1000.0, 490.473327842985, 93.0693463427853], [10000.0, 495.827228195844, 98.4232466956451]], "last_clr_calc_date": "9\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "10\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "1142.5383", "positive_round_contributor_count": 23, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "monthly-ethereum-news-development-update", "url": "/grants/665/monthly-ethereum-news-development-update", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0xe383549A1fB0A519F61e7F6F740A661B15e35AC8", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x87e92EF9f04631B9471674FA72347341EfAFF8CC", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 159, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/6c27af43ca6f1e7c0576af61e29a699b/download.svg", "details_url": "/grants/159/mask-networkmaskbook-the-portal-to-the-new-open-i", "title": "Mask Network(Maskbook) - The Portal to the New, Open Internet.", "description": "Mask Network(Maskbook) is a portal to the new, open internet.

It's very difficult to learn about because it is so complex and abstract.\n\nThis causes the majority of people to ignore it altogether.\n\nThis means new apps have fewer users, the industry isn't as big, there's less investment to fund development, infrastructure won't be as mature, and adoption will take longer.\n\nWe all want to hasten the adoption of decentralized technologies as fast as we can.\n\nThere is a need for more outreach to mainstream society.\n\nA solution:\n\nFund ads for my newsletter on Reddit and FB\n\nI run a newsletter that explains the basics of blockchain in 1-minute posts. It's non-shilling, tech-focused, and written for beginners.\n\nAn example is my latest, very well-timed post:\u00a0Why protocols > companies - an overview of Uniswap\n\nIt's usually well-received around here, but my main focus is to reach out to people outside of crypto.\n\nI would love to get it in the hands of more people but I have limited resources to promote it.\n\nWith some funding I'd be able to reach a much wider audience.\n\nIt would be nice if people logging onto\u00a0/r/investing\u00a0had a small introduction to blockchain as well.\n\nI think a lot of people want to learn but don't know how to get started.\n\nI plan to use the majority of funding to purchase ads.\n\nAds are a good candidate for funding because they're tangible, specific, and narrow in scope.\n\nI think this campaign will help accomplish my goals of awareness, exposure, and education.\n\nIf you'd like to support this effort, leverage up your donation with Gitcoin, and help accelerate Ethereum

it's Jakub here. Thank you for stopping by and considering supporting Finematics on Gitcoin.\n\nI started Finematics in April 2018. The initial idea was quite simple - create whiteboard animations explaining different concepts across technology and finance. At that time I was working as a senior software engineer for one of the biggest brokerage companies in traditional finance. \n\nI started creating videos on topics such as the Actor Model, Kafka and Two General's Problem. Prior to that, in 2017, I got really interested in the cryptocurrency space. What brought me to crypto was the open and permissionless nature of it. This led me to start a new full-time position working as a software engineer for one of the biggest companies in crypto. This is also when I started introducing some crypto content to my channel including topics such as the Lightning Network and the Bitcoin Halving. \n\nIn early 2020 I discovered decentralized finance (DeFi) and fell in love with this space. I was already passionate about technology, blockchain, crypto and finance, so DeFi was an ideal combination of all of that for me. This is also when I started pivoting my channel into more DeFi-related content starting from videos such as \"Smart Contracts Explained\", \"What is DeFi\", \"What are Liquidity Pools\" and \"What is Yield Farming\". \n\nPivoting my channel into DeFi instead of spreading my focus across multiple topics was a really good decision. In less than 3 months my channel grew from 2k to 14k subscribers accumulating over 200k views and 20k hours of watched content. \n\nFor me, DeFi is one of the most interesting and fastest-growing movements with an amazing potential of completely disrupting traditional finance. Although I believe DeFi is the future, it can be quite difficult for newcomers as it combines a lot of elements from two poorly understood subjects: finance and technology. I'd like Finematics to be a go-to source of free information about DeFi.\n\nHere is one of the examples of my videos on Yearn Finance and YFI\nhttps://youtu.be/qG1goOptZ5w\n\nI love the idea of being sponsored by the community.

The TE Commons will connect the best projects to the resources they need via the creation of a regenerative circular economy where:\n\nCapital supports contributions.\nContributions create value.\nValue empowers token engineers.\nPeople who appreciate token engineer empowerment contribute capital and govern the TE Commons.\n\nAt the same time, the TE Commons is the Iteration 0 \u201cField Test\u201d of the Commons Stack\u2019s Flagship Commons model specifically an Augmented Bonding Curve attached to a Conviction Voting DAO. The Commons Stack will ensure others can take the model created here and deploy it for their own use case. The data generated by the TE Commons will be used to help us improve the cadCAD models for these components.\n\nThe core objective of this Field Test is to create a comprehensive cultural build playbook on how to build the right culture for a community that wants to use this Commons model to create sustainable funding for governing their shared resources.\n\nRoadmap\nWe are on pace following our roadmap to launch this winter.

The goal of the project is to grow the global blockchain community in the locations where people\u2019s lives will be most transformed by the impact - in developing countries. By telling a story that is culturally relevant, we can help our readers see a future that is free from the issues they experience in their daily lives, while also providing them with the tools to create that future. The book will directly cover the basics, but it will also link to online blogs and other learning resources to help readers take the next step to becoming crypto users, entrepreneurs, and developers. We want to inspire the next generation of Africans to build with blockchain and be an integral part of the community.\n\nWe believe that the best way to build the best blockchain ecosystem possible and grow the community is to increase the number and the diversity of people building it. To achieve this, we will distribute an open-access, mobile-first digital version through key partnerships with tech and education networks.\n\nOur goal is to reach over 1 million African youth. \n\nThe team includes graphic novelist and storyteller Chief Nyamweya of Kenya, and blockchain educator and investor, Anne Connelly of Canada. To date, we have created the first chapter, mapped out the characters and storyline, secured a publisher and begun making key partnerships in the space to support the distribution of the book.\n\nFunding will support the artist's salary, partnership development, and the creation of the digital booksite.\n\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-24T19:33:53.047Z", "last_update_natural": "6\u00a0days, 18\u00a0hours ago", "sybil_score": "-1.7143", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/anneconnelly", "handle": "anneconnelly", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/dc354e82d91879e466dac9c00cc012d4/anneconnelly.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 156.776969078578, 0.0], [1.0, 180.113817969503, 23.3368488909252], [10.0, 195.772810646618, 38.9958415680406], [100.0, 208.08773466942, 51.3107655908418], [1000.0, 214.550008607194, 57.7730395286164], [10000.0, 217.14209148898, 60.3651224104023]], "last_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "15\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "284.3637", "positive_round_contributor_count": 14, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "100.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "trust-graphic-novel", "url": "/grants/211/trust-graphic-novel", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0x5f071C7c2f6CC6a51c091fd41a636152e83Caa40", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x15ef9189a8282E4e1e985EB8eD767e7426B4bfD5", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 413, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/e027b24a610c2caf7c25634243cf7684/Bildschirmfoto_2020-07-30_um_20.25.07.png", "details_url": "/grants/413/fusion-open-source-iconset-for-the-cryptospace", "title": "Fusion -

The book aims at giving the full account of experience with an end-to-end tool chain: from co-designing the digital ecosystem through games, to mapping the territory, to not mistaking the map for the territory. It's full of cautious tales, as well as the soothing layout of a tool chain that will assist you in designing, modeling, simulating, securely deploying, governing, and upgrading a token economy - building on the multidisciplinary foundations of cryptoeconomics. This is going to be a hell of a ride. So, grab your towel. \n\nUpdates since last round:\nDuring the crazy times, we got to spinoff a course for the Token Engineering Academy from the first iteration on Chapter 4 Token Model Generation! Through the course we connected 20 people and their fantastic token projects closer to Token Engineering, one of them projects is making it as case study into Chapter 4: DADA.art and their Invisible Economy, because of their unwavering demand for incentive mechanism design to protect intrinsic motivations! That's a challenge accepted!! And makes working on this book the more legen-wait for it\n\nWe have a fantastic Editor on board, and the crowd >> 1 slowly but surely! Now, help us grow the community of alpha readers, crowdwriters, -editors, -designer, -publishers, for potential sponsored editions - the goal is to make \"A Hitchikers Guide to Token Engineering\" be a great overview read and go virrrrrrral! We can use some help with putting it all on github and creating a SourceCred instance, too. Any support, spreading the word - and of course your contributions are appreciated highly! We're experimenting with variations of Community Currency in\u00a0 \"Potluck\" style. Join the Book Club at Token Engineering Discord channel to learn more on how to contribute. \n\nUpdate on the Annotated Table of Content on GitHub is coming right up! We added 2 new chapters and writers: \"Chapter 8. Legal Engineering\" and \"Chapter 9.

"details_url": "/grants/1166/open-reviews-a-web2-to-web3-replication-protocol", "title": "Open Reviews: A Web2 to Web3 Replication Protocol", "description": "Think Uniswap for reputation:\nReplicate your existing reviews from centralized Web2 platforms, like Airbnb, to Web3 with an open and unstoppable replication protocol.\n\nWhy?\n\nReviews are very valuable, they are the currency of trust.\nGuests write them for the Hosts but the platforms capture them, and they are then \"siloed\" for the platforms own business use.\n\nReviews Are Locked in\n\nWho should own a review?\n\nThe person who wrote it?\nThe person who received it?\nThe platform which hosts it?\n\nToday they belong to the platform which acted as a facilitator.\nWe don\u2019t think this is right.\n\n\nPeople and Businesses Are Locked in\n\nA person/business reputation is locked into the platforms.\n\nIf you are a Host and decide to stop using Airbnb or the account terminated, your reviews remain there and become basically useless.\n\nYou have worked years to accumulate them.\nYou went out of your way to accommodate the guests for those reviews.\nYou did this because they are valuable to you.\u00a0\nYou are being held to ransom but did all the work.\n\nAnd yet, you can\u2019t take them with you.\n\nWithout your listing, the reviews have no value to the platforms. \nAnd yet they keep them.\n\nThe platforms didn\u2019t write them.\nThe reviews are about your listing and your service.\nThe Guests wrote the review for you.\n\nYet the platforms keep them.\nThey\u2019ll sit on some backup server and nobody will ever see them again.\nAll those years of reputation and brand building are effectively gone.\n\nThey rather destroy them than allow you to export them and use them elsewhere.\n\nThe same thing happens when you get \u201cdeplatformed\u201d (your account is shut down): you lose years of work with no recourse.\n\nAnd what if you are a Guest with many great reviews?\nYou won't be able to use them in other platforms effectively needing to build your reputation from scratch every time you create an account in a new platform.\n\nUnlock Your Reputation\n\nWe believe you should be able to own your reputation.\nYour reviews, if you choose so, should be publicly available on the blockchain for everyone to read and embed in websites, apps and everywhere else.\n\nThis could theoretically be done by scraping them, saving them on a server and giving open access to everyone.\nIn this way unfortunately they'd lose the credibility because the Guests may ask:\n- Who exported the reviews?\n- Are these just the good ones?\n- Were they manipulated?\nAlso, the server would still belong to one company alongside its costs and business model.\nThe company will need to make money.\n\nBackup The Reviews On The Blockchain\n\nWith this project we want to unlink the reviews from the platforms lock in.\n\nWe will create a decentralized, unstoppable protocol.\nThe scraping will be done automatically with open source distributed software so that everyone can verify the reviews saved on the blockchain are the originals.\nWe will develop a decentralized interface where each user can initiate the export and pay for the gas to write the hash on the Ethereum blockchain and the content on IPFS.\nThey insert the link of the listing, pay the gas and obtain a URL where they can see their reviews saved on the blockchain.\n\nDone! They saved their reviews forever.\nNo one can take them away now.\n\nImmutability\n\nUsers can only instruct the system to take ALL reviews from a listing, as they are.\nThey can\u2019t edit them, hide the negative ones or do anything which undermines their veracity.\n\nVisitors will see the reviews exactly as they are on the originating platforms.\n\nThis is the new paradigm of Reputation: immutable, open and verifiable.\n\u00a0\n\nEmbed Them Everywhere\n\nOnce they are online, they can be embedded in a direct booking website for free (no gas required to read).\nEach review links to the original listing in order to make it easier for anyone to check\u00a0(i.e. \"see this review in Expedia\").\n\nOther platforms can use them.\n\nReputation Replication to Web3\n\nThese protocols will allow the replication of more than a decade of reputation to Web3.\nWe start with vacation rentals but anyone can build on top of it and serve other verticals (Amazon, Google etc\u2026).\nThe unlocked value is enormous.\nIt will increase the value and usability of the decentralized internet by many orders of magnitude.\nIt will also speed up the adoption of Dapps as they get populated with Web2 reviews and while the Web3 native reviews start picking up.\n\nA Simple Interface\n\nUsers won\u2019t need to learn much about Web3.\nThe most advanced ones will use a wallet like Metamask.\nOthers may prefer solutions like Portis with credit card payments of gas.\nThird party companies will be free to offer the possibility to no-coiners to pay in advance for the gas in fiat and applying meta transactions so that they can interact with the blockchain and don\u2019t worry about gas.\n\nEconomics\n\nWe may decide introduce a protocol fee to fund development.\nThis will be decided in the research phase.\nIf we go this way, here's a possible scenario:\nThe smart contract charges an ETH fee according to the number of listings (or some other metric).\nThis fee covers the initial gas and maybe a certain number of updates (reviews are added all the time) + a fee.\nThe fee goes in a DAO smart contract (based on Aragon, Daostack or others) and is managed by the DAO itself to pay for development, research and auditing.\nA native token is not necessary.\n\nWho We Are\n\nWe are Trips Community, a blockchain project born in 2017, and our aim is to build a completely decentralized booking platform.\n\nWe are vacation rentals veterans, and have been in this space long before Airbnb, Booking.com or Expedia.\nBlockchain early adopters, we have been accepting Cryptocurrencies for bookings since 2013.\n\nAmongst us there are the top industry leaders.\nWe are partners of Origin Protocol since 2017, and we are working together with them on our vertical.\nOur mission is to move the whole Travel Industry to Web3 as soon as possible.\n\nAims\n\nWith this grant we intend to start an in depth technical research and develop a first working version.\n\nVideo\nCheck out this panel in which we discuss the subject with industry experts:\nhttps://youtu.be/PIqe_g1VS9o\n\n\nFAQ\n\n- \"Won't the OTA fight this legally?\"\nSure, but do they really want to start this conversation?\nIt may end up badly for them and a judge may rule that reviews belong to the user, not to them.\nIf this happens the gates are open for disruption of their siloed data, not only from decentralized solutions but from a lot of centralized startups.\n\n\n- \"Won't the OTA fight scraping?\"\nThey probably will. At the moment this does not seem to be the case as there are several centralised companies doing exactly that.\nWhen this becomes a problem we may decide to use browser plugins where the user extracts the content and provides it to the protocol.\n\n- \"Won't the OTA deplatform Hosts who do that?\"\nIt\u2019s possible. They in fact deplatform for much less.\nThis is why each Host has to decide what is more risky: a complete dependency on OTAs or losing their reviews.\n\n", "last_update": "2020-10-01T07:18:52.213Z", "last_update_natural": "6\u00a0hours ago", "sybil_score": "0.3333", "weighted_risk_score": "3.3716", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/lucadgtrip", "handle": "lucadgtrip", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/beef5943a9155e450ed6605f9d171d08/lucadgtrip.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 856.302516332762, 0.0], [1.0, 892.575085870863, 36.2725695381002], [10.0, 918.66716509165, 62.3646487588873], [100.0, 938.417006763074, 82.1144904303115], [1000.0, 948.072593939046, 91.7700776062832], [10000.0, 951.721118333701, 95.4186020009386]], "last_clr_calc_date": "26\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "387.4433", "positive_round_contributor_count": 33, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "open-reviews-a-web2-to-web3-replication-protocol", "url": "/grants/1166/open-reviews-a-web2-to-web3-replication-protocol", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x2C5FF0Be38115Fe6E37ACce8e94F86186c3D73dF", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1170, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/150b38ba2cd6adf981c8677f98a72258/thumbnail.png", "details_url": "/grants/1170/yield-farming-tools", "title": "Yield Farming Tools", "description": "Provides tools and resources for aspiring and experienced yield farmers alike.\r\n\r\nFeatures pool section with APR, links, and pool balances.\r\nIncludes a beginner's section & useful tools for farmers of any experience level.\r\n\r\nSite: https://yieldfarmingtools.com\r\n", "last_update": "2020-09-15T06:46:57.800Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks, 2\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-0.3571", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/cartermcalister", "handle": "cartermcalister", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/5a769d8f4ce21487220cf25b8511ebc6/cartermcalister.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 89.2601974323162, 0.0], [1.0, 104.090098259764, 14.8299008274476], [10.0, 113.505004616958, 24.2448071846417], [100.0, 121.998596892121, 32.738399459805], [1000.0, 127.220645428019, 37.9604479957026], [10000.0, 129.511301041726, 40.2511036094102]], "last_clr_calc_date": "26\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "410.6293", "positive_round_contributor_count": 14, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "yield-farming-tools", "url": "/grants/1170/yield-farming-tools", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x1Ba0dc2bAB6Cf9EF50Dc63755246e90d6aa821C4", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 822, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/64f950afb0ea20cc2f7eee64c178378b/Screenshot_14.png", "details_url": "/grants/822/lukso-the-blockchain-for-new-digital-lifestyle", "title": "LUKSO: The Blockchain For New Digital Lifestyle", "description": "Today most Blockchain use cases are less interesting for ordinary users, as they are either very technical, financial focus, or too complicated to use.

We are passionate to bring more personalisation, transparency & User-centric gameplay in sports fantasy games. Our prime focus is to bring the sports (Cricket, football etc.) fans together and allow them to ask and predict custom questions related to match.\u00a0\nFor example, one can ask \"How many runs will Virat score\" and others can predict & win. \nWe currently also allow users to participate in live match scenarios too. We are working to showcase the live match playable as a game.\n\nSolution: We currently have full application prototype built on android platform and smart contract deployed on Matic blockchain. Our backend service allows option for users to create MCQ of the questions asked as well as real-time data monitoring using AI fetches the result of the question which in turn rewards the winner instantly using Matic blockchain. There is transparency in the whole system throughout for users.\n\nOur secondary objective apart from sports prediction is to allow our users play mini games multiplayer on same platform. We currently have 6 games namely Speed Chess, Math Clash, Ball in the Basket, 2048, Card game & Space Era. All these games are multiplayer and can be played free as well as by cash & providing game fee. The winner receives direct ~2x game fee reward.\n\nMarket: The fantasy sports market is expected to grow by USD 9.34 billion during 2020-2024, according to the latest market research report by Technavio.\n\nWe are looking for fundings so that we can do the remaining developments in game and launch it with better marketing of the product. \n\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-16T16:02:21.832Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks ago", "sybil_score": "0.3333", "weighted_risk_score": "1.1772", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "MATIC", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/iamjaspreetsingh", "handle": "iamjaspreetsingh", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/8d9777708bd1638cd4c699e20c3ea9e5/iamjaspreetsingh.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 122.475345415073, 0.0], [1.0, 138.55904189497, 16.0836964798974], [10.0, 154.216228174857, 31.7408827597846], [100.0, 169.296375113853, 46.8210296987797], [1000.0, 178.156619247269, 55.6812738321959], [10000.0, 181.852214342009, 59.3768689269357]], "last_clr_calc_date": "a minute ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "18\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "45.8671", "positive_round_contributor_count": 12, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "sportsdapp", "url": "/grants/996/sportsdapp", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x8d91c7bCE30e7EFA279881cB1bB4b8c4c9bD4461", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1175, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/effed827b92781e33ff5a3bb1a0f01bc/fuel26fd.png", "details_url": "/grants/1175/eth-gaswatch", "title": "ETH Gas.watch", "description": "ETH Gas.watch\u00a0is an aggregated gas price feed that checks multiple data sources for the latest gas prices.

To make DeFi more accessible, BanklessFR publications are entirely in French.\n\nBanklessFR adapts the model of BanklessHQ to offer a pedagogic discovery of DeFi and Open Finance. BanklessHQ's main concepts were adapted, such as the Skill Cube \u2014 one of the most interesting methods theorized by Ryan Sean Adams.\n \n\ud83d\udcdc BanklessFR History\n\nBanklessHQ funded the first three months of operations of BanklessFR thanks to the Bankless International Gitcoin Grant. We received 2000 DAI, mostly used to pay the work of Jon Otherbright, our main translator and head of publication. Check our current work on the newsletter or our twitter.\n\nWe crossed the 500 (free) subscribers mark mid-September.\n\nSo far, the newsletter is structured as follow:\n\nEvery other Monday, we catch-up with the state of the BanklessFR project and announce the next steps in the Monday Progress Review.\nEvery other Wednesday, we publish a Thoughts on DeFi \u2014 a BanklessHQ translation. \nElse, still on Wednesday, when there are no \"Thoughts on DeFi\", we publish a Thoughts Summary, offering a guided reading of the previously published pieces. It helps people who recently discovered the newsletter to catch-up and gather a high-level understanding of the content we offer. \nOccasionally, we publish a Thursday Special, a special issue to shine a light on French projects (or project with a French team member).\nFinally, on Friday, we propose an Open Thread, to exchange with the community on Twitter.\n\nAt the top of the newsletter, you'll find a look collating French resources on DeFi.\n\nA bit lower, we have a section dedicated to events. French-speaking events organizers can promote their events for free here.\n\n\ud83d\udc77  The Team\n\nJon Otherbright is the one in charge of BanklessFR and handling most of the workload. TokenBrice helped to get the project off the ground and is still actively involved.\n\nOur publications are also proofread by a team of volunteers, one of which even translated one our the Thursday Special posts. \ud83d\ude4f Huge thanks to them!\n \n\ud83c\udfaf Gitcoin Grant Purpose\n\nOur main goal with this grant is to gather sufficient fundings to keep the whole program open and free for all.\n\nIdeally, we'd like to grow the program even more while keeping it free. We will focus on translating the \"Tactics\" from BanklessHQ \u2014 pedagogic posts helping readers enforce a given strategy.\n\nBanklessFR needs a minimum of 700\u20ac/month to operate. The vast majority of our budget is used to support the translations efforts \u2014 essentially the work of Jon and its collaborators.\n\nWith a budget above 800\u20ac/month, we will be able to start including the \"Tactics\" in our editorial calendar.\n\nWe picture BanklessFR as a common, and this is the reason why we're coming to you today. Your donations are greatly appreciated and will help spread awareness and understanding of DeFi in French-speaking crowds.\n", "last_update": "2020-09-18T14:02:10.015Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 5\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-0.6154", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/otherbright", "handle": "otherbright", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/07f912d54a252ecabd2948c3a6beab2f/otherbright.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 397.483493818522, 0.0], [1.0, 437.618799031304, 40.1353052127829], [10.0, 466.753923926837, 69.2704301083158], [100.0, 490.797437869543, 93.3139440510212], [1000.0, 503.836791091995, 106.353297273473], [10000.0, 509.119302222016, 111.635808403495]], "last_clr_calc_date": "2\u00a0minutes from now", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "22\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "367.4142", "positive_round_contributor_count": 26, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "banklessfr", "url": "/grants/1274/banklessfr", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x7B187f598B910374109222BaC494F508a49bD209", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 358, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/29a8fb9a23759589c5e0a545125b25df/web3swift-logo.png", "details_url": "/grants/358/web3swift-elegant-web3-functionality-in-swift", "title": "web3swift - Elegant Web3 functionality in Swift", "description": "\n\nA full-featured native iOS/macOS library that provides Web3 functionality in Swift with native ABI parsing and smart contract interactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nweb3swift Overview & Project goals\n\n1. Keep an up-to-date web3 library on Swift\n\nContinuous support of the ongoing Ethereum ecosystem and language changes\nFor example:\nNew ENS Permanent Registrar \nhad been implemented before it was released: https://github.com/matter-labs/web3swift/pull/162\nOur community asked to add infura web sockets support  \nPR: https://github.com/matter-labs/web3swift/pull/144)\nSwift 5 update\n\n2. Provide the easiest on-boarding for iOS/Mac developers to build web3-based DApps\n\nWe provide the community with convenient tools to work with the Ethereum blockchain in pure Swift and the ability to quickly create secure decentralized applications (DApps) for Apple devices, without a need to study cryptography. This allows developers to focus on the content quality and UX/UI in DApps, which in turn increases the adoption of the Ethereum blockchain and community growth.\n\nWhy we are applying for this Grant:\n\nWe've developed web3swift as a side project. It falls in the category of public goods and isn't monetizable. Nevertheless it's useful for the ETH ecosystem.\nNow to keep the project up to date, to be on the wave of the Ethereum updates, and actively support them in the library, we want to move it to crowdfunding support. \nMatter Labs would like to eventually make web3swift a completely community-driven project. Right now, Petr Korolev (one of the co-founders) has volunteered to become a full-time maintainer. He should be considered the main responsible person for this grant.\n\nWho we are:\n\nMatter Labs was originally founded by the team of 3 developers/cryptographers and Ethereum contributors, multi-ETH-Hackathon-winners:\nETHParis (Pyromania)\nETHDenver zDai (2019)+ ios-smart-contact-interactions (2018), \nETHSanFrancisco - Advanced DEX tools\nETHBerlin - The Game Of Snarks\n\nand recipients of ETH Foundation Grants (Wave 5)\n\nResponsible people:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petr Korolev: Architect, tech coordinator(https://github.com/skywinder). The main responsible person for this grant\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alex Vlasov: Original author, now focuses on cryptography & research of Matter Labs (https://github.com/shamatar). Will help with fundamental questions\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anton Grigorev: Core contributor and community supporter, original co-maintainer (https://github.com/BaldyAsh). Can devote free time and experience to the project\n\nCurrent state\n\nOriginally web3swift was made by Alex Vlasov as a hobby project and later supported by him and Anton Grigorev.\nNow the development is effectively stalled cause original maintainers are a hundred percent busy with Matter Labs' original products.\n\nThe project is already in great demand: many teams have been using our code in production. It was also an essential part of several winning projects at ETHBerlin 2018 and ETHDenver 2019.\nNowadays, it is one of the most used iOS/macOS libraries for Ethereum with the community involved.\n\nHere is a list of examples: Apps-using-web3swift\n\n\ud83d\ude80 web3swift core features\n\n## Core features\n\n- [x] :zap: Swift implementation of [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) functionality \n- [x] :thought_balloon: Interaction with remote node via **JSON RPC** \n- [x] \ud83d\udd10 Local **keystore management** (`geth` compatible)\n- [x] \ud83e\udd16 Smart-contract **ABI parsing** \n- [x] \ud83d\udd13**ABI deconding** (V2 is supported with return of structures from public functions.

The protocol uses a system of networked\u00a0state channels,\u00a0a technology that allows peers to make unbreakable commitments\u00a0to one another, all of which can be adjudicated and resolved on the Ethereum blockchain in the event of a dispute. This lets users of the system make near-free, instant, programmable transfers in any currency, without ever needing to rely on third parties to store funds.\r\n\r\nWhat have we done?\r\n\r\nOurConnext's technology can also be used to interconnect EVM-compatible Layer 2 solutions such as rollup chains across Connext nodes. We showcased this in a demo for Reddit's Scaling Challenge: https://medium.com/connext/introducing-spacefold-d1c227a29d3 . We believe this is an extremely powerful construct that will significantly improve liquidity and onboarding/offboarding UX of siloed Layer 2 solutions, and we are excited to show off more projects like this. \r\n\r\nWe also worked with ExchangeUnion to release a Layer 3 solution for swapping between Connext's ETH mainnet and Lightning's BTC networks: https://blog.exchangeunion.com/launching-opendex-the-decentralized-exchange-standard-b907d2a99b5a\r\n\r\nFor those who have not been following us over the years, we have been building state channel systems in production since 2018. We built the original SpankChain SpankPay micropayment solution on mainnet, the first Ethereum mainnet state channel system in production. We built InstaPay, Metamask Mobile's in-app integration of Connext technology. We've also worked on integrations and PoCs with companies including dTok, Pitch, Loft.Radio, Zympay.\r\n\r\nWhat is this grant for?\r\n\r\nWe have used our learnings from real-world usage to build an extremely secure, optimized, and simple state channel protocol from the ground up: https://github.com/connext/vector. This system is an opinionated state channel protocol tailored for our specific use case: cross-chain/L2 conditional payments. By sticking to a single use case, we were able to reduce complexity and improve user experience significantly, and we are really excited to unveil our work!\r\n\r\nFunds from this grant will be used to accelerate development on our Vector state channel protocol and allow us to ship a battle-hardened system that feels magical to use.

In order to better utilize zk-SNAKRKs in projects, more developers need to have a better understanding.\n\nBuilding your first SNARK is often a challenging and unpleasant experience. In our quest to learn, refresh and teach, we\u2019ve found that there is no complete guide on the theory and development of zk-SNARKs. This is because the knowledge required to get started is scattered across a maze of interconnected blog posts and github libraries, making finding a logical entry point time-consuming and difficult. We believe this steep learning curve is creating a high barrier to entry in the space and therefore slowing the widespread adoption of the technology.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019d like to change that with our MoonMath Manual to zk-SNARKs designed for a broader audience with only minimal experience in cryptography and programming. By offering a comprehensive manual we can help to drastically increase the productivity of DApp development that require SNARK features in their smart contracts.\n\nWe aim to deliver a multidimensional handbook that will introduce you to the theory and application of zk-SNARKS from various angles. Beginning from a theoretical foundation, we will introduce some toy examples and carefully chosen hands-on exercises, building up to a point where the reader is able to implement complex, real-world zk-building blocks. This will include gathering many of the dispersed tutorials and shaping them into a cohesive, presentable manual that is designed specifically to make the learning experience smooth and efficient. The manual will serve as an entry point for beginners while also a reference for experts by integrating the various resources into a single manual.\n\nBudget:\nTarget budget for the first version of the online publication: 12,000-15,000 DAI\nAny additional funds will be spent on outreach and coordinating community feedback / participation with key partners\nSubscriptions could help with an ongoing maintenance budget.\n\nTimeline / Milestones:\nStart date: June 30, 2020\u00a0\nInitial draft for community feedback\nFirst release\nProgress depends on sufficient funding.\n\nReferences:\nWorkshop on The Mathematics behind zkSNARKS\nSlides\nLeast Authority - All published audits\u00a0\nLeast Authority Talk Videos 2017 - 2019 \nLeast Authority on GitHub\n\nOur team is also happy to coordinate with others interested in helping on this effort.\n\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-21T15:22:52.593Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 2\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-0.8929", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "INFRA TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/liz315", "handle": "liz315", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/d2ef732871c61c9e97f62df906da9a97/liz315.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 453.031079338296, 0.0], [1.0, 496.954504233702, 43.9234248954053], [10.0, 527.848789100355, 74.8177097620582], [100.0, 553.231623223171, 100.200543884875], [1000.0, 567.476131035052, 114.445051696755], [10000.0, 573.567277206108, 120.536197867811]], "last_clr_calc_date": "a minute ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "18\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "382.9841", "positive_round_contributor_count": 28, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "the-moonmath-manual-to-zk-snarks", "url": "/grants/543/the-moonmath-manual-to-zk-snarks", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0x3EC324E09F6233D156cE7e30DfCa7e6EFf312F1C", "token_symbol": "DAI", "admin_address": "0xA8A4912938549d50EF3E7c698C890E18D73408Ee", "token_address": "0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1219, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/9a2a5916f6d67be5753bceb3df48232f/DeFiLib7.png", "details_url": "/grants/1219/defi-library", "title": "DeFi Library", "description": "\nDeFi Library is a free source of information about DeFi for Turkish crypto community.

Decentralize Awareness (by Usecripto)", "description": "This project has a mission to bring crypto education to as many people as possible in our country. Brazil is a huge country, but people have very little knowledge about cryptocurrencies and are afraid to deal with it.\n\nIn early 2019 we wanted to accept Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in our business. After a lot of research, we realized that there was no content about usability here in Brazil. We didn't find the answers to the questions we were looking for. That's when we decided to start producing content geared towards crypto financial education. One of our flags continues to be usability. With a mobile phone and no previous video editing skills, we started creating and distributing free content to help others understand Bitcoin, Ethereum and cryptocurrencies in an uncomplicated, fun and didactic way.\n\nSome facts about crypto in Brazil:\n\nWe are a country with 209 million inhabitants\nWe are the second country that is most connected to the internet in the world\nWe are among the countries that most use cryptocurrencies, but the lack of information causes people to end up falling into scams\nWe are experiencing an economic crisis with our currency devalued and inflation.\nThere are already many scams involving cryptocurrencies, which made people very afraid of the subject.\n\nWe have been producing free educational content on Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in Brazil for a year and a half:\n\nOur Instagram account had more than 28,000 likes in the January content so far.\nIn 2020, our YouTube channel had more than 150 thousand views of the contents, tutorials and classes.\n\nWe want to reach a wider audience with our free content about this new decentralized economy and here's what we're proposing to do:\n\nStep 1: Bitcoin Fundamentals Course (Beginner Level)\nWhat is Bitcoin\nWho is Satoshi Nakamoto\nWhat is it for\nWhere do bitcoin live? Understand a blockchain\nWhy is it so different? (features)\nWays to own and buy bitcoin\nHow to store safely\nWhat are cryptocurrency wallets\nIs it considered an investment?\nHow to recognize scams and protect yourself\n\nStep 2: Ethereum and Defi Course (basic level)\nWhat is Ethereum\nHow it was created and who the creators are\nHow does Ethereum change our lives?\nSmart Contracts\nTokens\nHow to buy and download Ethereum\nWhat is Gas\nWhat is Defi\n\nStep 3: Circular Economy - How to accept cryptocurrency payments Course (for entrepreneurs)\nWhat are cryptocurrencies\nWhat is the advantage of accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment versus traditional forms?\nCryptocurrency receiving options\nReceiving and paying with cryptocurrencies (in practice)\nHow to save cryptocurrencies\nTransaction fees\nTransaction confirmations\nHow to deal with volatility\nStable options: as stablecoins\nScams, how to recognize and not fall into one.\n\nThese are the courses that we want to produce and make available online for free to Brazilians with the help of the community. How are we going to use this help to produce more educational content:\n\nWe will buy a camera to record the lessons in better quality (today our videos are recorded on the cellphone)\nWe will make a dynamic edition so that the classes are didactic, interactive and fun.\nWe will produce an unsigned website where we will host free courses, tutorials, tips and content.\nWe will continue to take free online classes on our Instagram to help more people understand cryptocurrencies and break free from the traditional financial system.\n\nWe work 7 days a week to make cryptoeconomics happen in Brazil. We will be immensely happy with your help to continue our mission to educate people for the new digital economy and show the way to true financial freedom for those who still doubt or do not know what Bitcoin, Ethereum and cryptocurrencies are.

Your support will help us get there.\u00a0\n\nAbout Seed Club\n\nSeed Club is an experimental incubator for community creators, builders, and dreamers.\n\nSocial Tokens represent a new way for creators, brands and communities to create value together. They enable the creation of individual crypto-economies with a digital asset at its core and offer creators new ways to engage their audience and monetize their work.\n\nBut Launching a token is more complicated than launching a newsletter or youtube channel.\u00a0\n\nCreators need to design the economic mechanisms that lead to a flourishing community, launch and distribute their tokens, navigate the worlds of liquidity and figure out how to grow value alongside their early community.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re launching the Seed Club, a social token incubator.\n\nWe\u2019ve brought together a stellar group of early social token issuers, technologists and entrepreneurs to help creators conceptualize, create and launch a Social Token.\n\nWe partner with creators, bringing access and insight from a diverse group of advisors, marketers, token designers and technologists, who all share in the upside of successful projects.\n\nSeed Club is a grass roots organization made up of early social token issuers, technologists and thought leaders. Our collaborators include: \n\nAlex Masmej ($ALEX), Priyanka Desai (The LAO), Brian Flynn ($JAMM), James Duncan (Abridged), Joon Ian Wong ($JOON), Reuben Bramanathan ($CNSL), Cooper Turley (Social Token Agency), Carlos Gomes ($SWAGG), Jess Sloss ($CLUB), Scott Moore (Gitcoin), Collab Land and Forefront.news\n\n\u2028What we\u2019re funding\n\nOur goal is for Seed Club to be community owned and governed. \n\nWe intend to launch our own social token to access the seed club community and help us grow. We need funding to reach that point, and instead of doing a private pre-sale, or large team allocation, your support here will allow us to conduct the fairest launch possible.\u00a0\n\nSeed Club will be community owned and stewarded, and your contribution will help us get there. \n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-15T20:55:39.067Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks, 1\u00a0day ago", "sybil_score": "0.3000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.7441", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/jesssloss", "handle": "jesssloss", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/c53158cc0b984fba1694aabea9b4d681/jesssloss.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 75.2903317478289, 0.0], [1.0, 88.7608489869799, 13.470517239151], [10.0, 99.4613534380784, 24.1710216902496], [100.0, 108.057976318273, 32.7676445704444], [1000.0, 112.439961094417, 37.1496293465878], [10000.0, 114.131493914707, 38.8411621668783]], "last_clr_calc_date": "3\u00a0minutes from now", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "23\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "76.5774", "positive_round_contributor_count": 10, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "seed-club-the-social-token-incubator", "url": "/grants/1210/seed-club-the-social-token-incubator", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x42DFAf5266Ad40AB4533F9806F5CC1DF4C1eB363", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1273, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/042132d650d68d57b4480b1abb831162/Recipes.png", "details_url": "/grants/1273/our-bible", "title": "Our Bible", "description": "The Bible should be accessible to everyone. At its core, the holy text was written to be inclusive of all of God\u2019s creation especially those on the margins. With all of the traditional versions of the Bible, \u201cOur Bible\u201d preserves the KJV Bible on the Ethereum blockchain one verse at a time. \nThe word of God faces threats from an ever-growing list of Bible versions as well. Bible versions besides KJV purport to improve readability, while in actuality they\u00a0change the meaning of verses and outright remove them.\nThanks to the immutable nature of Ethereum's blockchain, we have an opportunity to preserve the Bible. Together, we can add one verse at a time to the blockchain so it may be retrieved in a distributed way.\nWe can work together to maintain the word of God \u2014 free from the tampering of those who would seek its diminishment through adulteration.\n\nHow it works:\nThis Dapp interacts with a\u00a0smart contract\u00a0on the Ethereum blockchain to add verses from the Bible to the blockchain.\nThat smart contract includes an\u00a0oracle\u00a0that pulls KJV Bible verses from the Our Bible API. Once the oracle retrieves a verse, it sends the verse back to the smart contract where the verse is preserved on the blockchain.\n\nAll of Our Bible is open source! Take a look and contribute to the\u00a0site,\u00a0API\u00a0and\u00a0smart contract.\n\nHelp us develop this project by donating a little amount to this GRANT or on our website. The funds received will be used to add more features to the site.\nSome new and exciting features will include:\nA library of progressive devotionals \nAbility to chat with the Our Bible App community or just your friends\nVarious progressive podcasts, videos & more.\n\nPS: This is a developing project and we don\u2019t have a social media presence for now but as time goes, we will start creating social media platforms for this project.\n\nGod bless you richly as we help preserve the bible together.\n", "last_update": "2020-09-18T13:31:02.210Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 6\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "2.4211", "weighted_risk_score": "62.4525", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/jonnwall", "handle": "jonnwall", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/7778a233adb27674b6f4910176cbe11d/haotop.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 118.145963752861, 0.0], [1.0, 134.722762445874, 16.576798693013], [10.0, 149.957355202104, 31.8113914492428], [100.0, 163.286508053143, 45.1405443002819], [1000.0, 170.318774978, 52.1728112251388], [10000.0, 173.050447952309, 54.9044841994478]], "last_clr_calc_date": "28\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "80.8737", "positive_round_contributor_count": 19, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "our-bible", "url": "/grants/1273/our-bible", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x9E1441dc213CeA8c8c059F01bBa6B8f410674e7a", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": false}, {"id": 1088, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/0229a4016c0f55ffed9e46862c99486c/LogoCroppedCenturyGothic.gif", "details_url": "/grants/1088/creol-environmentscreol-offsets", "title": "Creol Environments/Creol Offsets", "description": "Creol is a company that builds carbon positive people, places and things. We do so using advanced IoT systems and blockchain to track, control and reduce energy usage in commercial buildings. While tracking this energy, the system realtime carbon offsets itself using grid mix Oracles that query grids to calculate the footprint of the system in real time. Carbon tons brought onchain as 1:1 pegs to VERRA VCS tons that are retired in legacy systems, are used in subtokenized quantities and can be offset down to the gram of CO2e. This in turn, ensures that buildings operating a Creol system, are carbon neutral by default and in some cases, carbon positive. This in turn can address 30% of worldwide emissions today. \n\nWe present two projects that we intend to deploy on Matic.\n\nCreol Environments:\nhttps://creol.io\n\nWhich is our IoT based system that is able to be controlled, tracked and monitored all on chain. We are currently migrating the system to Matic to ensure long term scalability. This is the system that intends to drastically change how we control buildings today. It's first application was one we developed for lighting control using existing lighting infrastructure today. It uses advanced 802.15.4 communication protocol Thread to ensure 256bit encrypted messages between nodes in the system. State changes are tracked and attested by the hardware and submitted on chain for tracking and then offset using the onchain VCS 1:1 tons. \n\nCreol People:\nhttps://beta.creol.io , https://footprint.creol.io , https://business.creol.io\n\nCreol People is an extension of Creol Environments that allows regular people to subscribe to a carbon offset subscription using a credit card and a regular email. It uses the same onchain VERRA VCS carbon tons that the IoT system uses and each ton is given directly to the subscribers account. We aimed for complete simplicity with this system, by employing wallets that sign in using gmail/email from Torus and Portis and combining GSN into our smart contracts, we have been able to streamline the onboarding process for users and make sure that people completely uninitiated to crypto can still sign up and do good for the environment. We intend to migrate our system to Matic as well to ensure that we can remain cost competitive with other traditional offset subscription providers.\n", "last_update": "2020-08-27T14:54:46.820Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0month ago", "sybil_score": "-0.2308", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "MATIC", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/judokick", "handle": "judokick", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/55c2574e0cb1281cbc8bc7212dd45c68/judokick.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 205.04230389404, 0.0], [1.0, 228.104134975529, 23.0618310814891], [10.0, 244.202373805366, 39.1600699113261], [100.0, 258.241982499234, 53.1996786051945], [1000.0, 266.307025498559, 61.2647216045198], [10000.0, 269.678728963757, 64.6364250697178]], "last_clr_calc_date": "a minute ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "18\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "305.6594", "positive_round_contributor_count": 13, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "creol-environmentscreol-offsets", "url": "/grants/1088/creol-environmentscreol-offsets", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xB65B6cb75c7D558CA39dbB098F5B9A7B690164fc", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1091, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/5bcb26fae7585e47bfe284d342bfe77f/5f6d4d75fcab0b3de70b5590_webclip.jpg", "details_url": "/grants/1091/upside-is-a-social-media-platform-linked-to-an-ac", "title": "UpSide is a social media platform linked to an activated savings account that unlocks premium content and a chance to win monthly prizes", "description": "UpSide is a social media platform linked to an activated savings account that unlocks premium content and a chance to win monthly prizes.

For content creators its a platform where you can build a monetisable and resilient audience with a better incentive structure so you don't have to be clickbaity, extreme or polarising because it's not driven by ad revenue. \n\nHistory\nUpSide was born out of\u00a0Hack Money, and part of the fabulous Gitcoin KERNEL program. We started with a vision to build an application that would give content creators a means to earn a living wage, users to build a capital position and to build a healthier online experience free from advertising, bots and trolls using the magic of DeFi. We are pleased to say this vision is now quickly becoming reality!\n\nHow does it work?\nYou can see a clickable prototype and we're keen to get your feedback. Our MVP will launch with just the prizes to win hosted by us. \n\nYou can also see our 3 min pitch \n\nA player joins UpSide and creates a wallet, they can then follow creators for free but most of the content is gated. You can get access to this content by adding money to your wallet through the content creator memberships which means interest earned is directed to the content creator but the principal is always yours and you can withdraw at any time. By contributing money into the content creator pools they also earn a chance to win monthly prizes offered by the content creator. \n\nWhy UpSide?\nIf you are wondering about the name, it\u2019s UpSide because there is literally no downside for users who get a chance to win something without having to pay for it. \n\nWhich DeFi platforms are we using? \nUser funds are deposited into Aave (and soon also Yearn.Finance) to generate attractive interest rates.

It allow custodial signing with verifiable timestamps which enabled any non web3 users to follow a familiar lifecycle and take advantage of decentralized storage and network.\r\n\r\nA notary uploads a template PDF and adds signatures (signature_pad) blocks to allow touch friendly signatures. An identifier is added to the PDF to make the document unique and the hash is stored on an ethereum smart contract. The document itself is encrypted via Space Daemon + Textile and stored on IPFS for previewing by all parties.\r\n\r\nUpon transaction confirmation, an event call is caught by a webhook which then fires signature requests to all signers. Each signature request is accompanied by a unique token generated by an email oracle to verify the authenticity. Upon a \"draw\" signature, the data is encrypted and stored on IPFS.\r\n\r\nOnce all signatures proofs have propagated on chain, the smart contract fires a \"notarization request\". The email oracle now generated a new token and sends to notary for signing.\r\n\r\nUpon propagation of notary's signature, the backend orcale makes a final document with all signatures and stores the final hash on chain - each party received the final document with metadata for verifying proofs.\r\n\r\nThe open sourced proof page on IPFS allows any party to verify the authenticity of the document and timestamp of signatures by using a web3 browser like Metamask. Even if the project/backend ceases to exist, the proofs on chain and files on IPFS allows independent verification of legal documents.", "last_update": "2020-08-17T20:34:59Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0month, 2\u00a0weeks ago", "sybil_score": "-0.6364", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "MATIC", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/swarooph", "handle": "swarooph", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/e51b3c3bacfbd9ec07f0d4a70d92dc5e/swarooph.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 67.2854238934023, 0.0], [1.0, 79.4296983746353, 12.144274481233], [10.0, 92.6050148176448, 25.3195909242424], [100.0, 107.283737230178, 39.9983133367756], [1000.0, 116.952774582741, 49.6673506893389], [10000.0, 121.214816588352, 53.92939269495]], "last_clr_calc_date": "a minute ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "18\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "34.6741", "positive_round_contributor_count": 11, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "blocksig-notarized-document-signing-on-ethereum-a", "url": "/grants/1068/blocksig-notarized-document-signing-on-ethereum-a", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x007b003C4d0145b512286494d5Ae123aeEF29D9E", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1264, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/1dad9cd6128d3760fd8c600e0d4acc9b/gabriel-removebg-preview.png", "details_url": "/grants/1264/talking-crypto-with-gabriel", "title": "Talking Crypto With Gabriel", "description": "The goal of Talking Crypto is to educate the DeFi community, inform about new projects and to produce content that is current in the fast paced crypto landscape.\n\nWe want to empower users to be comfortable using DeFi and enable them to make prudent decision about capital allocation.\n\n Accomplishments to Date\n\nOn August 25th, I posted my first DeFi video.

See our:\n\t- Decentralized search engine: almonit.eth \n\t- Browser extension: Firefox, Chrome\n\nUpdate, Sept 2020. We are working on a Alpress, a Decentralized blogging system\n\nAlpress is a self-governing and self-censoring content publication platform, where users and contributors co-own the product and decide on its guidelines for participation.\n\nWe believe that Alpress is an essential tool for the Ethereum ecosphere. Right now most Ethereum projects and individuals are using centralized content platforms that do not share the same values with the Ethereum ecosystem. The leading platform used by most Ethereum projects has had countless censorship incidents specifically targeted at crypto projects.\n\nWe need an Ethereum native blogging and publishing platform that utilizes the latest tools and developments in the space such as decentralized websites, ENS + IPFS, Ethereum based donations, and is owned by those who use and contribute to it\n\nAdvantages of Alpress over legacy publication platforms: \n- Full ownership of your blog or publication without the need to host and maintain your own server\n- Network effects and discoverability of a social platform, without centralized power to the founders / investors.\n- Community owned, participation and contribution grant you voting rights in the platform.\n- Privacy to authors and readers, at least as much as Ethereum and IPFS are private.\n- Censorship-resistance, as there is no one owner to the platform.\n- Robustness, since it is extremely difficult to block or take down IPFS based website.\n\nAll project contributors are doing this on their free time, any help in development, design, feedback, and community building are all equally helpful as a Gitcoin donation. \n\nJoin our public telegram group:\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe web is a collection of a few giant websites. Organizations online became dependent on those websites to maintain, manage, moderate and govern them.\n\nThis dependency becomes expensive in the long run, as third parties services get more and more expensive. This dependency is also an issue for political organizations or organizations in countries with strong Internet censorship.\n\nDwebsites (Decentralized websites) offer a solution to those issues. Dwebsites are independent of third parties, allowing organizations to maintain and govern their platforms themselves. Dwebsites are censorship-resistance, robust and private.\n\nThe goal of Almonit project is developing Dwebsites technology and tools, increasing its adoption and usage as an alternative to current websites.\n\nWhat Almonit does\nAlmonit is a gateway to Dwebsites. Our technology allow people to access, search and build Dwebsites. Those websites relay on existing protocols, such as Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS).\n\nWhat are Dwebsites? Traditional websites use a server and a name service (DNS) to be accessible. Dwebsites replace the server with decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Swarm, Sia) and the DNS with decentralized naming service (e.g., ENS, Unstoppable Domains, Namecoin). The resulting Dwebsites are censorship-resistance, robust and private.\n\nDwebsites also allow communities to create their own online platform, without using any third party and without putting trust in any of its members. It is a perfect solution for modern internet organizations.\n\nWe care about users privacy. Our technology lets users keep their privacy. There are no intermediaries or third parties involved in the process of using decentralized websites, all actions can be done in communication with only the decentralized storage and decentralized name service networks.\n\nAlmonit vision\nAlmonit vision is for Dwebsites to become a popular alternative for the current website model. In this vision we see Almonit as the starting point of any usage of the Dwebsites world.\n\nProjects running under the Almonit Project umbrella\n\t- Almonit Decentralized Search Engine\n\t- Almonit Dweb Browser Extension\t\n\t- Almonit Decentralized Blog Engine (=decentralized Medium)\n\nDecentralized Search Engine [almonit.eth]\nAlmonit decentralized search engine is a search engine for Dwebsites which is a Dwebsite itself. The search engine runs in client-side and on IPFS network, offering a search feature in a way which is 100% private to Almonit. Almonit has no way of knowing when users make searches or what they search for.\n\nWe aim for it to be the first decentralized website you encounter in the Dweb. The decentralized search engine was released in January 2020, and is already featured in Dweb and Ethereum events all over the world.\n\nDweb Browser Extension [Firefox, Chrome Web Store]\nAlmonit Dweb browser extension allows users to easily use Dwebsites in the browser. \n\nThe extension works in all major browsers, including Firefox, Google Chrome, Brave, Opera with a release for Tor browser planned for 2020.\n\nAlmonit Decentralized Blog Engine\nAlmonit decentralized blog engine is a tool to easy publish and maintain articles in a decentralized way. Think of it as a decentralized Medium.\n\nThe engine will include a simple design, with WYSIWYG editor to make publishing process easy and quick.\n\nThe decentralized blog engine is currently under development. We aim to publish its first version in Q3 2020.\n\nAlmonit Team\n\nEyal Ron [Github, Linkedin]\nPhD in Mathematics, co-founder of Cryptom, author of two DIN (German national organization for standardization) Blockchain specifications, previous core developer of Bisq (under the alias Neiman), a peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange.\n\nMuhammed Tanr\u0131kulu [Github, Linkedin]\nSenior Software Engineer at Golem Factory, experienced Javascript and blockchain developer.\n\nKrzysztof Lewosz [Linkedin]\nSST Manager in Egmont Polska, Supervisor in Vaultex UK Ltd.

The importance of communities has been made even more vividly for us over the past six months during the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of locally-based volunteers and Mutual Aid Groups (MAGs) has multiplied and have been exceptional examples of willingness of individuals to contribute to and commit to the common good and welfare of one's own community. Mutual Aid Groups were revitalized about 15 years ago from a different historic purpose. MAGs are organized by and for individuals, on the bases of non-political solidarity, reciprocity, volunteerism.\u00a0\n\n\u269b\ufe0fWhat is FightPandemics?\nFightPandemics is an open source altruistic platform that connect individuals and organizations that need help with those that can provide it at the local and global level.

We have around 30 people who have an important role within the community and we call them coordinators, they are the true engine of this open source organization as they identify what are the issues to be solved and connect them with the skills offered by different volunteers. Our team was born out of the need of a tool for connecting needs and resources and were not motivated to join based on money or titles, but rather belief in the social mission which are the core pillars who are leading the organization. \n\n\ud83d\udcb8Why Gitcoin Grants?\nSince the start of the organization, we haven't received any monetary (FIAT/Crypto) donations apart from what we are receiving here. All the donations that we have received, have been contributions with time from our volunteers and +35 organizations (Notion, Slack, Hopin, Airtable, Gitcoin Kernel & Apollo Fellowships + more) that have supported us with credits.

To achieve this goal, Sourcify supports several efforts to foster adoption of open-source source verification, metadata files and NatSpec comments.\nAt its core, Sourcify currently maintains\nan\u00a0interface\u00a0that helps developers to verify metadata and contract source code.\na\u00a0contract repository\u00a0of all verified contracts.\na\u00a0monitoring & verifier service\u00a0that checks for new contracts on Ethereum blockchains (mainnet and testnets) and tries to verify them automatically.\nSourcify basically provides the base layer, which allows other tools to be built on top of it. Its main purpose is to keep metadata and source files available via IPFS and Swarm (preventing that the links in the bytecode turn into dead links).\nBesides the technical infrastructure, Sourcify is also a collective movement to bring transparency and awareness to the space. We try to educate and build bridges between development tools, wallets, interfaces and other components which all play an important role in demystifying interaction with smart contracts for the end user and hence making blockchain interactions safer.\n\nHow are we going to use the funds? \n\nFunds collected will be mainly used to pay transaction fees! We'll update the contract repository more frequently and will be moving the IPFS infrastructure to a new ENS domain (sourcify.eth).\n\nWant to help us without funding this grant? \n\nYou can do us a huge favour by spreading the word about the importance of source verification and NatSpec or directly about our project!

So now come and build proven safe DApps faster than you've ever built DApps before. :)\n\nReach will enable tens of millions of developers to participate in the blockchain community, rather than only the thousands that participate today, by drastically lowering the barrier to entry into blockchain and drastically raising the productivity of DApp developers. A Decentralized Application that used to take months to develop will be able to be completed in weeks.\n\nThe Reach platform provides three services via a domain-specific language (DSL) for specifying DApps and a specialized compiler that projects the specification into the complete application while performing automatic verification of correctness properties.\n\nHigh-Level Language\nWe allow the developer to write and think at the level of business logic, rather than at the level of the intricate details of a blockchain protocol. Our DSL uses a subset of JavaScript to specify the entire DApp: the smart contract, the clients run on the front-end, the servers run on the back-end, and all communication between each of the pieces. Since the entire specification is in a single language, we enable any developer to quickly create, reason about and deploy DApps.\n\nBlockchain Agnostic\nWe represent the DApp with a generalized backend language, and we then use \u201cconnectors\u201d to translate this backend language to the correct bytecode, while remaining faithful to the interfaces offered by actual networks. Our backend supports the ability to specify blockchain-specific functionality, where appropriate.\n\nSafety Guarantees\nWe ensure that the DApp is free from errors without having to write tests of what the program should do. Instead, developers write down what their program must not do, and we ensure that these bad outcomes never occur. The compiler uses type-checking, A Normal-Form transformation, information-flow security, and end-point projection to derive each component correctly from the single specification. The compiler is integrated with a satisfiability-modulo-theories (SMT) theorem prover (e.g. Z3) to automatically check the correctness of the application via developer-specific predicates, as well as automatically generated properties appropriate for all DApps.\n\nConsensys Grant a Success!

We were aware that the hackathon may be harder for new developers but were amazed when one of the solo participants ended up winning Sia's $700 (in SC) bounty. \ud83c\udf89\n\nThree teams from the second Cohort participated in EthGlobal's #HackFS. BlockSig was a finalist and along with Team Azureus won bounties from Fleek.

It is already useful to process XInclude, XML comments, and some home-made XHTML extensions.\nSee https://vporton.github.io/xml-boiler-docs/ for help.\nThis project supersedes failed project https://github.com/vporton/xml-boiler-java and https://github.com/vporton/xml-boiler.\nProject description\nOverview\nIt was written a specification (draft but already \"functional\") for automatic transformation and validation of complex (possibly multi-namespace) XML documents based on namespaces, written a software (XML Boiler, see https://github.com/vporton/xml-boiler) to implement these transformations. Written a short tutorial for XML Boiler.\nMost of the specification was implemented in Python programming language. This project prototype \"XML Boiler\" is already nearly complete and is practically useful.\nThe most high priority current project goal is to rewrite the entire project in D programming language (because Python was found too slow and also not enough reliable).\nAlso we need better validation support and more transformers/validators need to be written, as well as many more features to implement. The specification needs to be improved to reach non-draft state.\nAdditional project purpose: Develop some general purpose (foundational) libraries for D programming language.\nThe benefits of the project include:\nfreely intermix tag sets of different sets of tag semantics (using XML namespaces), without disturbing each other (such as by name clash) in the global world\nadd your new tags to HTML (and other XML-based formats)\nget rid of using HTML in the future Web, switch it to proper semantic XML formats\nmake XSL-format based browsers with automatic generation of XSL from other XML formats\nmake automatic coloring of source listings (for example)\nadd macroses and include (such as by XInclude) other files in XML\nintermix different XML formats, with intelligent automatic processing of the mix\nembed one XML format in another one\nautomatically choose the order of different XML converters applied to your mixed XML file\nmake browsers to show your XML in arbitrary format\nmake processing XML intelligent (with your custom scripts), both on the level of scripts and on the level of interactions between scripts\nintegrating together XML conversion and validation scripts written in multiple programming languages\nassociating semantics (such as relations with other namespaces and validation rules) to a namespace\nsemantics can be described as an RDF resource at a namespace URL (or a related URL)\nmany more opportunities\nintegrate all of the above in single command\n\nIntellectual Merit\nThere was no automatic way to transform between XML files of different formats previously. This new way is a technological revolution. The same concerns validation of multi-namespace XML documents.\nThe main author\u2019s invention is an elaborate automatic selection of the order (with repetitions if needed) of the XML transformations apply to the transformed XML file or its parts (processing of XML file by parts is also an author\u2019s invention).\nThe project\u2019s philosophical value is assigning semantics to XML namespaces, mainly as interrelations between different namespaces, what was previously considered like something non-existing.\nThe specification written is a breakthrough in XML processing. Many details were needed to be resolved in a clever way when writing it.\nThe D language is considered by the author as the currently most advanced and perspective programming language, thus making the purpose to advance D libraries important. Broader Impacts The project intends to replace older means such as HTML and TeX/LaTeX, so revolutionizing such things as the Web and scientific writing.\nA future HTML replacement could be done in practice in the following steps:\nDevelop some tag sets by independent users or standardization committees. Use my software to convert XML files containing them to usual HTML for legacy browser compatibility.\nStandardize news tag sets as a part of a new post-HTML standard(s).\nSupport the new tags sets in browsers (and other HTML software such as search engines). This would provide a smooth, multi-stage transition from legacy HTML to a new standard, what is before was impossible due to complexity of this global social process not being split into appropriate multiple stages, not allowing public participation of persons outside central standardization committees and smooth transition to new standards while the browsers are not yet updated (the chicken-egg problem: we were unable to update browsers while the standards are not yet updated and unable to update standards while the browsers are not yet updated, and also the need to do all the work in a central standardization committee not allowing enough public participation in developing a future HTML replacement).\nFuture TeX/LaTeX replacement could be done by developing a tag set (possibly including MathML for math formulas) for formatting complex \u201cscientific\u201d documents together with tag set(s) for complex Turing-complete logic (for such things as macroses and conditional processing, etc.) like one of TeX but much more convenient for the users and for transformation and data extraction software. Then this software could be optionally (partially) standardized. Unlike the above proposal of replacing HTML, for the TeX replacement it is not strictly necessary to create a browser software supporting it, but my software (together with scripts for it by other users) could itself be used as a TeX/LaTeX replacement. Then software for data transformation/extraction for databases like Scopus could be developed.\nIn the future RDF documents describing semantics of namespaces could be placed at namespace URLs (or related URLs) to support for anybody to be able to create and distribute his own XML tag sets standards and their semantics, without the need to resort to central standardization committees. (Scripts referred from such RDF documents could be executed in secure software sandboxes.)\nThe project files (including the documentation and study materials) are openly disseminated to the public, including by the means of Wikiversity study and research site.\nThe project improves Internet democracy and broader participation of underrepresented groups by allowing anyone to create his own XML standards.\nThe project develops free software: both specialized software for XML processing and general purpose software libraries.\n", "last_update": "2020-09-17T00:11:00.971Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks ago", "sybil_score": "0.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "INFRA TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/vporton", "handle": "vporton", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/f463560f3304fbf84193ae1acd9ad7ad/vporton.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.191829850206845, 0.0], [1.0, 2.33792410827082, 2.14609425806397], [10.0, 4.55859010848105, 4.36676025827421], [100.0, 6.8146315174569, 6.62280166725006], [1000.0, 8.18740820379432, 7.99557835358747], [10000.0, 8.76712159809422, 8.57529174788738]], "last_clr_calc_date": "51\u00a0seconds from now", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "20\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "5.7000", "positive_round_contributor_count": 2, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "automatic-transformation-of-xml-namespaces-and-xm", "url": "/grants/178/automatic-transformation-of-xml-namespaces-and-xm", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0xF9b4b9B368B6726375cda41eE910a4DB7F9AFD77", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x36A0356d43EE4168ED24EFA1CAe3198708667ac0", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 179, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/7bd64d9e2c3f7158b21971bf7929d8e6/56588528_2662246267125677_5140711176228831232_o.jpg", "details_url": "/grants/179/algebraic-general-topology", "title": "Algebraic General Topology", "description": "In short: I did a math discovery that would be done shortly after 1937 but nobody before me was able to guess during about 60 years. I need money to advance this amazing project further.\nI do mathematical research in fundamental abstract mathematics on the following topics:\nA new subfield of General Topology, done in an algebraic way. It is a big revolution in mathematics. I think my research is worth prizes of Nobel level. See\u00a0this page\u00a0for all info about my research. This can be read even by beginning college students, by the way.\nTheory of formulas\u00a0(a smaller discovery but also interesting). Mathematicians studied almost everything except of formulas themselves.\nI need money to support my life, buy books, etc., visit scientific conferences.\nProject decription\nOverview\nAlgebraic General Topology (= theory of funcoids, reloids, and their generalizations) is a wide generalization of general topology, allowing to express topological properties by algebraic formulas.\nVictor Porton wrote his book \"Algebraic General Topology. Volume 1\" containing a description of this theory (with definitions, theorems, and proofs, as well as expository material allowing its reading by beginning students).\nIntellectual Merit\nAlgebraic general topology is obviously an exceeding breakthrough because:\nIt is a new big branch of mathematics.\nIt is a very general theory based on humorously simple axioms.\nIt is expressed in algebraic form, not just a mess of quantifiers as old general topology.\nIt contains among other a definition of (generalized) limit of discontinuous function, what is expected to make a revolution in such fields as differential equations.\nThe general topology was generalized for an arbitrary kinda multidimensional case (while traditional general topology appeared to be 2-dimensional).\nThe idea of turning a category with additional structure to a semigroup is also novel.\nThe definition of funcoid is the biggest discovery in general topology since 1937 (when filters were defined).\nThe work also contains a generalization of filters on posets and other significant discoveries.\nIt is a common generalization of calculus and discrete mathematics.\nCommon generalization of continuity, uniform continuity, proximal continuity, Cauchy-continuity, discrete continuity.\nIt is connecting two previously thought unrelated branches of mathematics: general topology and ordered semigroup/monoid theory. Ordered semigroups are used to describe general topological properties in a novel way; general topology and calculus bring new concepts (such as three kinds of continuity or monovaludness) into ordered semigroup theory.\nAuthor proposed a new way to define \u201csides\u201d of manifolds and related things in a more natural way. We previously used the word \u201cside\u201d of a surface but didn\u2019t really know what it really is.\nThe book is a good studybook. Also it is the world best reference on the topic of filters on posets.\nBroader Impacts\nAs author's experience shows that we discover new unexpected results in traditional point-set topology using author's method. This tendency is expected to continue. General topology and thus related branches of science change radically.\n(Generalized) limit of discontinuous function is expected to revolutionize differential equations, integrating, etc. and consequently such natural sciences as physics, engineering, and economics. It also simplifies existing research methods.\nThe project implies broad dissemination of my knowledge to the entire mathematical community to foster further science development.\nThe resulting book can serve as a base of college courses on different topics of algebraic general topology and for a college course on filters on posets and lattices, because it is written as a studybook.\nIf you are a teacher, you can make the following college courses using it as a studybook:\nbasic order theory\n(co-)brouwerian lattices\nfilters and filtrators\nfuncoids\nreloids\ninterrelationships between funcoids and reloids\nmultidimensional general topology\nand more\n\nP.S.

We are developing an app and an open framework that can be used by third parties as a secure voting layer. During the last 2 years, we have been researching citizen participation, civic engagement, and governance processes and now we are close to releasing a smartphone app. (Techincal info at the bottom)\n\nWhat is Vocdoni?\nOur main aim is building a trustless voting system, where anyone can speak their voice and where everything can be audited. We are engineering building blocks for a permissionless, private and censorship-resistant democracy.\n\nWe believe that easy-to-use technology can boost participation in any scenario, lowering the existent barriers: from formal political participation such as Participatory budgets, informal organizations like a group of friends or, also, advocacy movements that require different levels of privacy and anonymization.\n\nWe intend the algorithms, systems, and software that we build to be a useful contribution toward making violence in these cryptonetworks impossible by protecting users' privacy with cryptography. In particular, we aim to provide the necessary tooling for the political will of network participants to translate outwardly into real political capital, without sacrificing privacy.\n\nThe open platform\nDuring this journey we started building the roots, what we called Vocdoni Open Stack, an open platform to make governance processes, transparent and secure while protecting user privacy and maximizing usability while making voting universally verifiable and scalable to millions of participants.\n\nWe built it on top of decentralized technologies (such as Ethereum, Tendermint, and IPFS) to guarantee the integrity of the voting processes and prevent disruption from attacks, and making use of Zero-Knowledge cryptography to ensure full anonymity to their participants.\n\nBlockchain voting for everyone\nOn top of the shared infrastructure, we are building Vocdoni's participation platform. A mobile-first app focused on making participation tools frictionless while giving them more security, transparency, and verifiability guarantees that nation state elections ever had.\n\nWe want these tools to be accessible to anyone, from your grandma to the state, and not only crypto nerds. We want the users to engage with their organizations and actively participate in everything they care about while having their identity and their data safely protected.\n\nDo you want to support Vocdoni?\nVocdoni is currently running private trials and is looking for organizations to be part of the first pilot tests. If you are interested, please request an invitation here.\n\nAt this moment we are looking for funds to boost our development and expand our community via gitcoin bounties. If you like what we do, donate us via Gitcoin.\n\nIf you want to know more about the project, contact us directly at hello[at]vocdoni.io\n\nMore information\nFor further technical information see our Vocdoni Open Stack docs and our Gitlab repo.\n\nAlso, you can follow us on \ud83d\udce3Telegram, \ud83d\udc26Twitter and join our \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2642\ufe0fTelegram Community.\n", "last_update": "2020-09-23T21:22:09.453Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week ago", "sybil_score": "-0.6842", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "INFRA TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/ferranrego", "handle": "ferranrego", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/13eeaa26ee3fe273f4baa81953c69500/ferranrego.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 1250.57343992535, 0.0], [1.0, 1311.18277780088, 60.6093378755354], [10.0, 1353.28641581998, 102.712975894632], [100.0, 1387.7730355053, 137.199595579951], [1000.0, 1406.35572346845, 155.782283543107], [10000.0, 1413.83084973687, 163.257409811524]], "last_clr_calc_date": "23\u00a0seconds from now", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "20\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "704.3168", "positive_round_contributor_count": 38, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "vocdoni-decentralized-anonymous-voting", "url": "/grants/202/vocdoni-decentralized-anonymous-voting", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0x97af99921C349679D98145229a6D96E1d8DC279A", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x74D8967e812de34702eCD3D453a44bf37440b10b", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 229, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/3f41d3df724eee32c8f97ef263e65d7e/CuraDAI.png", "details_url": "/grants/229/curadai-a-defi-based-stable-coin-for-curacao", "title": "CuraDAI - A DeFI based stable coin for Cura\u00e7ao", "description": "CuraDAI is a DeFI based digital currency that serves as a (better) alternative to the local currency of Cura\u00e7ao, a small Caribbean island just north of Venezuela.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCurrent Situation\nThe local currency, Netherlands Antillean guilder, is pegged to the price of United States dollars. This peg has many benefits, such as stable prices and volume, but also has some downsides. For example, all international transactions need to pass through an American correspondent bank. Besides adding extra costs and duration to the transactions the correspondent banks can also limit the local banks in their ability to process financial transactions. A result of this is the fact that it's near impossible to purchase or sell cryptocurrency from a local bank account.\n\nFor a more detailed overview please take a look at the CuraDAI Webpage or WIKI.\n\nCuraDAI\nWe've first hand experienced the opportunities the Ethereum and DAI ecosystem provides and want to give this power to the local population. Therefore we're creating a version of DAI that leverages the DeFI ecosystem while tailoring to the local needs of Cura\u00e7ao.\n\nCuraDAI has the same unit of account as the local currency, is 100% backed by DAI and will enable digital p2p transactions opening up many new markets on the island.\n\nPlay around with the working prototype here and get yourself some CuraDAI \ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f\n\nOnce we reach a tipping point with CuraDAO (around 1000 users) we will start document the entire process of building, launching and promoting CuraDAI.

Every time an individual uses the CuraDAI contract, to lock DAI and mint CuraDAI, a small fee (spread between the buy & sell price) is sent directly to the CuraDAO as a contribution to the island.\n\nPlease consider helping us build a DeFi based alternative to small nation currencies that are pegged to the dollar and empower a population of 160.000 to do business digitally and gain access to the opportunities of the DeFI space.\n\nWhat we were able to do since Gitcoin Grants 5 thanks to you!\n\u2022 Create a new UI for the CuraDAI DAPP\n\u2022 Create a CuraDAI WIKI\n\u2022 Enable E-commerce transactions by intergrating with MyCryptoCheckout\n\u2022 Integrate with Totle \n\u2022 Enable direct purchase of CuraDAI via Transak\n\u2022 Onboard the first 7 merchants\n\u2022 Create a Uniswap Pool with over 2k in liquidity\n\u2022 Fund the creation of a local Synthropic Food Forest via CuraDAI\n\nWe would like to continue the developed of CuraDAI and are currently working on!\n\u2022 Continue to run a local adoption campaign - grow to 50 merchants and 1000 users in the next 3 months. \n\u2022 Having conversation with the local Government and Central Bank to discuss a formal collaboration\n\u2022 Continue to integrate with more solutions \n\u2022 Start ideating and developing a fully localized complementary currency that runs on a POSDAO goverend by the local community.\n\nWe hope to receive your support again.

But it becomes unrealistic to achieve when political parties have their conflict of interest, and leaders don\u2019t have the expertise to make evidence-based policies and neither have the skill and manpower for solving problems that surround our society and ecosystem. The new fair democracy provides an elegant way of governance that separates the representative responsibility according to their specialization and can grow into any complexity. The governance is divided into various departments, and each department is supervised by representatives with expertise in the field. Voters need to have enough knowledge about the departments and their problems, in order to vote for the selecting representatives of a department. The selection process of representatives is \u201cdifficult in and easy out\u201d, which allows only utilitarian actors to hold the responsibility, weeding out frivolous ones.\n\n1) Fair (treating people equally without favoritism or discrimination) and equal opportunity to succeed for each and everyone.\n2)Decentralized Democracy, No authoritarian regime or no anarchical regime (leaderlessness or ignorant leaders lacking knowledge or good judgment)\u00a0and no concentration of power, because the\u00a0ability to approve policy is limited only to the concerned department who have the required expertise to make a decision.\n3)\u00a0Evidence-based democracy, Only evidence based policies are allowed, and representatives need to be experts in the field and each statement they make in the policy has to be backed by evidence and sound reasoning.\n4) No catch22 paradox, that is people have true freedom to remove their representatives easily without the involvement of any vested interest or party politics.\n5)Collaborative democracy, Collaborative problem solving, not by competition.\nAs all representatives have almost an equal chance of getting remove if the behave frivolously (not having any serious purpose or value), they have to collaborate in order to solve a problem, not compete for each other.\n7)\u00a0Infinitely Stable Democracy,\u00a0Indefinitely stable government, voting will continue in short intervals like 6 months, but the government will remain stable infinitely.\n8) No\u00a0nepotism (the practice among those with power or influence of favoring relatives or friends, especially by giving them jobs), frivolous one just can\u2019t stay.\n9)\u00a0No conflict of interest democracy, No in-group or out-group bias, representatives can take their individual stand, without considering the profit and loss of their alliance and opponent. Democracy design where conflict of interest is not plausible. Not a don\u2019t be evil design, but a can\u2019t be evil design.\nAs there are no opponent parties with their self-interested goals, and representatives are experts in their respective fields, consensus to reach a decision will be more objective (not influenced by personal feelings or opinions; considering only facts) and justifiable.\n\n10)\u00a0Evolutionary democracy, that gets adapted and refined with an increase in efficiency and productivity of representatives with each election every 6 months, as bad candidates are removed by voters.\n11)\u00a0Blockchain democracy, without any middleman or brokers such as politicians (MPs, MLAs, PM, CM) and bureaucrats, who delay the implementation. People will transact directly with their service provider departments.\n12)\u00a0Mega participation democracy, with a massive number of expert representatives per department, who can implement policies collaboratively within a limited extent of time as it makes a decent ratio between population versus a department. Representatives will also assign tasks to voters, common citizens, and students to quickly get the job done by volunteering.\n13)\u00a0Mobile and global democracy, where boundaries between countries become obscure with time, the expertise of representatives matter, not the origin.\n14)\u00a0Inclusive democracy, people are not discriminated because of origin, color, gender, sexual orientation, type of job, culture, age, legacy, ethnicity, generation, genetic characteristics and disability.\n", "last_update": "2020-09-19T11:10:57.772Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 5\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "0.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/amiyatulu", "handle": "amiyatulu", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/6a8b7b44b2abd5c691cdbf4611a5c2dd/amiyatulu.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.930282453442816, 0.930282453442816], [10.0, 1.75275424280074, 1.75275424280074], [100.0, 2.43296184021608, 2.43296184021608], [1000.0, 2.77330594634007, 2.77330594634007], [10000.0, 2.90166614467352, 2.90166614467352]], "last_clr_calc_date": "7\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "12\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "4.7500", "positive_round_contributor_count": 1, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "shivarthu-democracy-the-blockchain-based-decentra", "url": "/grants/445/shivarthu-democracy-the-blockchain-based-decentra", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0xc9B1e8Db13FddEa6b23652341BdA0562B392128B", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x7e30FB962f951ef78D901865F87DD036fc5aa946", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": false}, {"id": 459, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/d9383a39e226db90f176c492e8e053b4/dlogo_opengraph.png", "details_url": "/grants/459/foundational-d-language-libraries", "title": "Foundational D Language Libraries", "description": "A bunch of foundational D Language libraries:\nstruct-params-dlang - default values of parameters through structs\npure-dependency-injector-dlang - pure dependency injector\ndistro-dlang - determine OS version\nshlex-dlang - parse shell-like (config) files\nmemoize-dlang - memoizing return values of class and struct methods\ntuple-modifiers-dlang - add/remove modifiers of each tuple element\nredland-bindings -includes RDF file format support etc., for D (needs a rewrite)\n(more to add)\n", "last_update": "2020-09-17T00:09:35.194Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks ago", "sybil_score": "0.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/vporton", "handle": "vporton", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/f463560f3304fbf84193ae1acd9ad7ad/vporton.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.930282453442816, 0.930282453442816], [10.0, 1.75275424280074, 1.75275424280074], [100.0, 2.43296184021608, 2.43296184021608], [1000.0, 2.77330594634007, 2.77330594634007], [10000.0, 2.90166614467352, 2.90166614467352]], "last_clr_calc_date": "8\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "11\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "4.7500", "positive_round_contributor_count": 1, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "foundational-d-language-libraries", "url": "/grants/459/foundational-d-language-libraries", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0x17e05Bf448a8539C6075a3D7Cf9432763F061e77", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x36A0356d43EE4168ED24EFA1CAe3198708667ac0", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 462, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/cddf9568d7616a94864510579c0c797e/logo512.png", "details_url": "/grants/462/savedai", "title": "saveDAI", "description": "Overview\nsaveDAI is an easy way to open an insured, high-interest savings account, full stop.\n\nsaveDAI is the first self-insured asset (that we know of).

This is possible because we maintain a reserve ratio of 25%. Also because the currencies are not accepted in the larger cities, they tend to pool and circulate within the local community. We estimate that each DAI donated to this Gitcoin Grant will have the impact of $10-20 worth of direct cash donation in Kenyan Schillings.\n\nHow Community Inclusion Currency (CIC) based Aid works as a cash distribution method during a crisis:\n\nWith unstable food systems and deteriorating markets and supply chains, knowing how to target aid is crucial to providing relief and building more resilient communities.\n\nSarafu, a Community Inclusion Currency (CIC) in Kenya, has a rapidly growing distribution network with 11k (mostly very small) businesses in some of the poorest regions. Users form markets to trade goods and services using the vouchers and the data is stored on the blockchain. Using the blockchain transaction data we can target specific health and food related businesses to receive aid based on how connected they are to their community. These businesses can convert their CICs to donor funds using Mpesa with local community groups.\n\nFarming, Food/Water, Health would be primary targets for CIC Aid. Grassroots Economics, the Sarafu CIC manager, processes data minute by minute on the most important parts of these networks and can focus in a way that can show tangible results - in terms of targeting cash distribution to hubs and promoting specific circulation, supply chains and markets.\n\nSince 2010 Sarafu transactions have been reviewed and deemed an acceptable means of transaction by the Government of Kenya without violating any Kenyan Laws. The system works over USSD so that anyone in Kenya with a sim card can use it - No Internet or Smartphone required.\n\nParameters:\nAnyone with a sim card can sign up for Sarafu and receive an initial 400 Sarafu\nThe weekly CIC Aid amount is determined by the amount of available aid funds and crisis projections.\nCIC recipients will get additional CICs proportionally to how many people they trade over 20 Sarafu to on a weekly basis.\nUsers in specific business categories (Farming, Food/Water, Health) and deemed as hubs will receive double the Sarafu aid.\nUsers can refer other users for an additional 100 Sarafu.\nAnyone can use Mpesa to buy Sarafu at a discount rate (based on how much Aid fund there is in total) and the current supply of Sarafu in circulation. We are giving out 2x the Mpesa sent to us in Sarafu for the next 90 days.\n\nOutcomes:\nAid funds are distributed and targeting fairly using parametric triggers based on market centrality and business type.\nCIC circulation \u2013 not being cashed out is ~10x times larger than the Aid funds being used.\nCIC Circulation data helps identify:\ncurrent and future targets for aid\navenues for trade, sharing and social cohesion\nReporting and Dashboarding:\nGE provides weekly reports on targets, distribution and impact measurements.\nA public dashboard shows the various effects.\n\nNext Steps:\nBegin on data analysis and targeting\nInform existing key hubs\nBegin test distribution on Monday\nMonitor results:\nIncreased trade frequencies and volumes\nIncreased market size and density\nSurveys:\nUser Feedback collected\nUser Stories\n\nCurrent Statistics: ( COVID-19)\nSince April 2020 we tracked roughly 40 Million Shillings worth of transactions among over 24,000 Sarafu users trading basic need.

Despite, in most cases, ruining a user's ability to remain anonymous, it is difficult to track back to user conversion (i.e. Did Bob sign up? Did Alice take this offer?)\n\nUsing existing Ethereum primitives, DappLaunch enables developers to collect and communicate with Ethereum account addresses.\n\nGetting Started\nTo get started, you simply sign up at https://dapplaunch.xyz.\nNext, create a 'Site', then copy the generated form code to your website or landing page and start collecting web 3 addresses. Then, create and schedule HTML-based campaigns to send out to your subscribers.\n\nWhat's the user experience like today?\nDappLaunch provides a familiar experience to email marketing software with automatically generated form code, ability to manage multiple sites and campaigns, editable contacts list, drag-and-drop editing of HTML messaging, campaign scheduling, bulk mailing, etc.\n\nWhen did the project start?\nThis was an EthLondon project by the Mailchain team in March 2020. You can read about it in the blog post here.\n\nWhat protocols does it support?\nEthereum (+ testnets)\n\nDoes it support ENS?\nOf course!\n\nWhat is the grant for?\nSpeeding up development, improving UX, and adding more features.\n\nHow does this help the Ethereum ecosystem?\nAs more DApp teams build their decentralized projects and games, it is important to their marketing experts with the types of tooling and user experiences they are already familiar with. DappLaunch is intuitive for any marketer who has worked with email marketing platforms.\n\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-19T19:21:41.731Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 4\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-1.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/tboeckmann", "handle": "tboeckmann", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/285e65fdc559ebc9d865c3e97477d4e8/tboeckmann.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]], "last_clr_calc_date": "12\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "7\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "0.0000", "positive_round_contributor_count": 0, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "dapplaunch-web-3-marketing-messaging-platform", "url": "/grants/626/dapplaunch-web-3-marketing-messaging-platform", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0x2Fa12E52dF21FDF0Ed6A7B691CdbeB17860D089d", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x54114CA776E856c2AAee1eaC8e889D5334d9c439", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 634, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/cccf733b49ae2622fbf4011e9210e588/LikeCoin_PressKit_Logo_Fullcolor_Round.png", "details_url": "/grants/634/likecoin-republic-of-liker-land", "title": "LikeCoin - Republic of Liker Land", "description": "LikeCoin is a public blockchain for content monetization, attribution, and distribution. \n\nEmpowered by LikeCoin, media form Republic of Liker Land, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governed by liquid democracy.

This format lets readers quickly play catch-up on weekends instead of having to go through and digest hours of content themselves. \n\nLaunched in Jan. 2020, the Intelligencer is a labor of love publication by me, William M. Peaster, a professional writer and editor who's been tracking the Ethereum and DeFi beats in recent years. I've long wanted to chip in to the Ethereum community in a deeper way. As I started researching NFTs deeper last year, I realized this newsletter was a low-hanging fruit for me. \n\nWhat do I hope to accomplish going forward? I want to continue shining a light on the amazing, overlooked creative projects Ethereum is powering in the here and now, as well as on the possibilities to come. I also want to continue cheerleading for the talented pioneering artists and developers who are making these projects possible. These folks and their efforts warrant more attention and education, and that's where the Intelligencer comes in. \n\nI write this newsletter because it's fun and fulfilling to serve, and I'd love to expand the publication and go deeper with it to make it that much more useful for the community. Every donation of ETH, DAI, or beyond will go toward helping me sustain and grow the Intelligencer into the best possible resource it can be for the Ethereum ecosystem in the years ahead. Let's learn and build together. \n\nThanks kindly for your time and consideration, and stay creative!\n\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-22T01:03:23.376Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 2\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-1.7143", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/wmpea", "handle": "wmpea", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/2253a087ad54dd37123dbc08621df335/wmpea.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 18.7932515771333, 0.0], [1.0, 26.8724381099265, 8.07918653279319], [10.0, 34.8077746444137, 16.0145230672804], [100.0, 42.4600541458147, 23.6668025686814], [1000.0, 46.906193907581, 28.1129423304477], [10000.0, 48.735137675406, 29.9418860982727]], "last_clr_calc_date": "10\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "9\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "24.8925", "positive_round_contributor_count": 7, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "defi-arts-intelligencer", "url": "/grants/759/defi-arts-intelligencer", "contract_version": "1", "contract_address": "0x94b341cbe839294a9f33e8e5cb62298e18e62ecd", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x08cEb8Bba685ee708C9c4c65576837cbE19B9dea", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": false}, {"id": 778, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/6292ed9fb71d53678f81b7eadaa07407/Open-Source.png", "details_url": "/grants/778/blockchain-research-open-source-research-for-ever", "title": "Blockchain Research: Open-Source Research for Everyone", "description": "Blockchain Research\u00a0is a research and learning focused, open-source, high-graphic, and UI-driven platform that aims to increase investor education and awareness regarding bitcoin, ethereum, and everything related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\n\nPlatform:\u00a0https://blockchainresearch.in\n\nThe problem? - Our Mission\n\nIn our markets and ecosystem, newcomers and retail investors suffer financial losses or fall prey to scams or financial frauds due to inadequate research before investing in digital assets or companies.

What will you do? If you go to Google News, you will be shown the recent articles/posts only.

They possess the authority to allocate high-value resources between complex systems. Often even working autonomously. This makes smart contracts an essential, and critical component in these systems. This increases demand to comply with transparency and trust in the ledger and its information.\n\u00a0\nWhat\nSmart contracts need to be open, transparent and for everyone to verify. Users should be able to understand the risks and value of smart contracts before they transact with them and without having to be, or rely on software developers.\u00a0Contraktor allows anyone to visualize, verify and interact with the smart contract's resources and state without having any implementation logic in place. Making it easy for further integration or consumption.\n\u00a0\nHow\nContraktor is a stand-alone application that automatically generates a UI from the smart contract's specification ('ABI'). These specifications are pulled from a block explorer (e.g. Etherscan) or can be managed on a more decentralized source, such as IPFS. Increased decentralization will increase transparency.\n\u00a0\nThe goal is to create a universally shared and open-source registry of verified smart contracts. Maintained and inspected by a diverse community of experts. Allowing anyone to visualize, interact and monitor these contracts through a common application that is understandable by anyone.\n\u00a0\nDevelopment roadmap\nAn initial prototype of Contraktor UI was developed during ETH Global's #HackMoney. The prototype allows to visualize and browse verified smart contracts on different public Ethereum (test-) networks. It contains a registry of common DeFi projects, such as Aave, Compound, Uniswap and ENS to explore related smart contracts and deployments. This makes it easy for DeFi users the assess the risks and value of smart contracts before they transact with them.\n\u00a0\nRepo: https://github.com/wslyvh/contraktor\nLive demo: https://contraktor.netlify.app/ \n\u00a0\nThis proposal is to extend on that idea and continue development.\n", "last_update": "2020-09-16T09:02:27.422Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks, 1\u00a0day ago", "sybil_score": "-2.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/wslyvh", "handle": "wslyvh", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/7f0ab328a177b3771d4e62d871563240/wslyvh.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.16430965394541, 1.16430965394541], [10.0, 1.99121828924431, 1.99121828924431], [100.0, 2.56795301605426, 2.56795301605426], [1000.0, 2.82687165859894, 2.82687165859894], [10000.0, 2.91997281074085, 2.91997281074085]], "last_clr_calc_date": "18\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "a minute from now", "amount_received_in_round": "9.5000", "positive_round_contributor_count": 1, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "contraktor-a-smart-contract-explorer", "url": "/grants/828/contraktor-a-smart-contract-explorer", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x1e52C0887bc0F752368dFb80974ec988Ab40AED3", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 840, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/4534aa70ccd61513e8a7a7909f14fb71/logo.png", "details_url": "/grants/840/ethereumdevio-free-tutorials-for-learning-solidit", "title": "EthereumDev.io | Free tutorials for learning Solidity, DeFi programming and more since 2017", "description": "Ethereum Dev is a collection of classes that helps begineers and experienced developpers learn and build on Ethereum since 2017.\n\nTutorials covers:\nGetting started with Solidity\nInteracting with the blockchain from Javascript\nBuilding on top of DeFi (ERC20s, DEXes, 1inchExchange, flash loans...)\n\n\nAll the content is completefly free and I'm looking for you help to continue it. \n\n\nSome example of tutorials:\nTrading and Arbitrage on Ethereum DEX: Get the rates\nSwap tokens with 1inch Exchange in JavaScript: DEX and Arbitrage\u00a0\nInteracting with a smart contract from JavaScript\n\n\nFunds received will be used to:\nPay for server costs\nWrite new articles \nContinue to take time to do individual support with beginners\nKeep the website ads free since 2017\n\n\n\n\nThanks everyone!\n\n\n\n\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-19T09:04:45.653Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 5\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-1.1667", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/jdourlens", "handle": "jdourlens", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/a465dea477d18bf9c0a627e94773f950/jdourlens.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 8.55513681351721, 0.0], [1.0, 14.0452630897392, 5.49012627622204], [10.0, 20.1863483221238, 11.6312115086066], [100.0, 27.0955711992728, 18.5404343857556], [1000.0, 31.7671166800027, 23.2119798664855], [10000.0, 33.88447621742, 25.3293394039027]], "last_clr_calc_date": "11\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "8\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "12.6883", "positive_round_contributor_count": 6, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "ethereumdevio-free-tutorials-for-learning-solidit", "url": "/grants/840/ethereumdevio-free-tutorials-for-learning-solidit", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x19dE91Af973F404EDF5B4c093983a7c6E3EC8ccE", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 902, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/108f7f78bcbdb6cd8362ba1de6171624/received_1660678054093909.jpeg", "details_url": "/grants/902/the-marma-j-foundation", "title": "The Marma J Foundation", "description": "Our Mission\r\n\r\nThe Marma J Foundation Grant aims to grow community projects and businesses, with a focus on social and economic prosperity.

This project will exist both physically and virtually:\r\nPhysical - The founders of the Marma J Foundation will be purchasing gift cards and essential care packages and giving them out to at-risk, homeless, and anyone else who needs love in their life. \r\nVirtual - Chloethedev will be going live on YouTube on weekdays talking about how we are spreading love at the Marma J Foundation. Additionally, this will be an opportunity to highlight \"Bobby's Places\", a Cryptovoxels parcel dedicated to people with autism and learning disabilities, to showcase how the parcel is spreading the love in the metaverse. \r\n\r\nThe STL project will be documented on our blog.\r\n\r\nProjects Supported\r\n\r\nEach Gitcoin Grant round, the Marma J Foundation will be supporting up to three projects and initiatives.

Our goal is to educate these three projects on Ethereum and blockchain technology so that one day soon, self-sovereignty can be theirs.\r\n\r\nGrant Allocation\r\n\r\nFunds raised from the Gitcoin Grant will be divided in a 50:50 ratio; 50% of the funds will go towards the Marma J Foundation operations (funds will be converted to ETH and sent to the marmaj.eth wallet), and 50% of the funds will be distributed to the three projects supported.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOur goal for future Gitcoin Grant rounds is to change the distribution ratio to distribute more funds to the projects supported. The eventual goal is to divide the funds at a 10:90 ratio with 10% going towards the Marma J Foundation operations, and 90% to be distributed to the projects supported.\u00a0\r\n\r\nGet Involved\r\n\r\nJoin the Marma J community in one of our chat groups, check out our projects, or follow us on social media!\u00a0\r\n\r\nCryptovoxels\r\nDiscord\r\nStatus\u00a0\r\nInstagram\u00a0\r\nFacebook\r\nTwitter\r\nLinkedIn", "last_update": "2020-09-14T23:08:30Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks, 2\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-1.8750", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/chloethedev", "handle": "chloethedev", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/94d0492fc21d79e8cf612238f14a39fa/chloethedev.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 42.8801862848314, 0.0], [1.0, 55.0314416984874, 12.151255413656], [10.0, 64.5092292981653, 21.6290430133339], [100.0, 72.1309129290719, 29.2507266442405], [1000.0, 75.9750593388613, 33.09487305403], [10000.0, 77.4401141360818, 34.5599278512505]], "last_clr_calc_date": "12\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "7\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "74.1966", "positive_round_contributor_count": 8, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "the-marma-j-foundation", "url": "/grants/902/the-marma-j-foundation", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x549Adf7B383A1645F26a2AcFE09c5304B679A532", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 916, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/3ff8cc44b3665de35e56d05918fdc36b/hand.png", "details_url": "/grants/916/ancient-beast", "title": "Ancient Beast", "description": "Support my eSport game project, AncientBeast.com\nturn based strategy\nfree open source\nbrowser based\n1vs1 or 2vs2\n\nYou materialize and control a carefully selected squad of creatures to defeat others.\nOver 50 creatures to choose from, each having unique stats and abilities.\ncreative commons licensing\nmore units sets coming\n3d modeled in blender\n\nThink of chess combined with card games, while also having some moba elements (Dota 2 / League of Legends).\nIt's like the reverse of Super Smash Bros Brawl as it features lots of original creatures\nthat already made their way into 3rd party games and cg animations.\nThis grant helps out a lot with new releases:\nfixing lots of bugs\nimplementing new features\nrevamping ugly code\nadding playable creatures\nadding creature animations\nnew combat locations\nnew epic soundtracks\n\nFeel free to \ud83c\udf1f our repository https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast\nor drop by our official Discord server \ud83d\udcac https://discord.gg/x78rKen\n\nAlso check out this other grant, it pokes game development in the right direction imho:\nhttps://gitcoin.co/grants/1140/game3js-a-javascript-game-framework-for-web-30\n", "last_update": "2020-09-17T18:12:33.241Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 6\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-8.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/dreadknight", "handle": "dreadknight", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/1cce2f68af0be7f3f6e89a32c9862f38/dreadknight.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.885902590644344, 0.885902590644344], [10.0, 1.9535338859852, 1.9535338859852], [100.0, 3.15644505753145, 3.15644505753145], [1000.0, 3.91969086225479, 3.91969086225479], [10000.0, 4.24422840149378, 4.24422840149378]], "last_clr_calc_date": "12\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "7\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "1.2845", "positive_round_contributor_count": 1, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "ancient-beast", "url": "/grants/916/ancient-beast", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x21f53DB4D2eAcde70a2E4F0407D073C971eC1A33", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 934, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/883172712a82f924f0b5b3794851cfcf/Skylark.png", "details_url": "/grants/934/blockchain-threat-intelligence-weekly-newsletter", "title": "Blockchain Threat Intelligence -

As mentioned in the original grant description, no funds from this grant will go towards Ethereum Foundation or ConsenSys employees/contractors and any excess funds in the multisig when EIP-1559 is deployed will go towards a future Gitcoin CLR match pool. \r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOriginal Grant Description\r\n\r\nThis grant will support the research and development of blockspace & fee market improvements for Ethereum, in particular of EIP-1559.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhy you should care about EIP-1559\r\nIn short, EIP-1559 will help make transaction fees more predictable on the network, and ensure ETH\u2019s economic value is enshrined at the protocol level. For a full overview of the EIP\u2019s impact, we recommend Eric Conner\u2019s Medium post. \r\n\r\nAlong with EIP-1559, other proposals have been made to improve the transaction experience on Ethereum, notably the \u201cescalator fees\u201d proposal. As part of the work for EIP-1559, additions such as this one may be considered, as long as they do not significantly slow down implementation and deployment.\u00a0\r\n\r\nA curated list of resources related to 1559 and other proposals for fee market changes can be found at the Ethereum Cat Herders website.\r\n\r\nWhy we have to turn to the community\u00a0\r\nThe Gitcoin Grant will *not* cover all of the costs associated with this work. ConsenSys, through their hiring of implementers in PegaSys and the Ethereum Foundation, through their hiring of various researchers and implementers, are already covering the bulk of the development costs for this EIP. Funds from the community will serve two main purposes:\r\n\r\nFirst, they enable us to cover expenses related to development and testing of this change that are not covered by either ConsenSys or the Ethereum Foundation. Specific examples are given in the section below. \r\n\r\nSecond, if there is broad support, even at a low dollar amount, for this grant, it will help serve as a signal to core developers of the community interest in seeing this EIP go live. \r\n\r\nFinally, we commit to returning any funds received and not spent on the development and deployment of blockspace & fee market improvements to further Gitcoin CLR matching rounds.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHow we plan on using the funds\r\nThe funds will be used to pay for things like:\u00a0\r\nClient Implementations:\u00a0\r\nWhile the PegaSys team is providing a Besu implementation as part of their work for ConsenSys, other implementers are currently not compensated. Specifically, the Vulcanize team working on the Geth implementation would be intended recipients of this grant.\r\nSpecification Audits:\r\nThe need for a formal analysis of the blockspace & fee market improvements specifications has been brought up several times when discussing EIP-1559 and other alternatives. If no one with relevant skills can volunteer such an analysis, we will likely use funds from the grant to pay for one.\r\nBounties:\r\nFunding smaller tasks through bounties that do not justify a full grant cycle as well as encouraging participation from the community will be explored as a possible use of this fund. Some examples included, incentivizing testnet participation, bug bounties, wallet reference implementations.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nOther Testing or Development Work:\r\nChanging the fee market on Ethereum is one of the largest changes being planned for Eth1 to date. It will require extensive testing, including potentially new testnets and/or private \u201cephemeral testnets\u201d. Funds from the grant may be used to pay for development work or computation costs associated with such activities.\r\n\r\nHow we will administer the funds\r\nFunds will be administered by people familiar with the progress of the work and who will *not* be direct recipients of them. Current administrators include Tim Beiko (PegaSys), James Hancock (Ethereum Foundation), Dan Finlay (MetaMask), and Pooja Ranjan (Ethereum Cat Herders). Other administrators may be added to get to a \u2157 multisig threshold before spending funds.", "last_update": "2020-09-14T18:15:25.757Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks, 2\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-0.4872", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": false, "clr_round_num": "", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/timbeiko", "handle": "timbeiko", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/7d45797cb3c5e60371c184af1629d327/timbeiko.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 35578.6455704196, 0.0], [1.0, 35659.3305016105, 80.68493119091], [10.0, 35716.1005532507, 137.454982831092], [100.0, 35764.9955986582, 186.350028238623], [1000.0, 35792.6154030894, 213.969832669791], [10000.0, 35804.1804643705, 225.534893950913]], "last_clr_calc_date": "2\u00a0months, 3\u00a0weeks ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "11739.7566", "positive_round_contributor_count": 39, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": false, "slug": "eip-1559-community-fund", "url": "/grants/946/eip-1559-community-fund", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xc2EBDCabf77976dA4DD3b80BeDe87bF72C59118f", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 965, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/534662798451cd88d85f5d3837ff9034/20200629_202422.jpg", "details_url": "/grants/965/nifex-crypto-exchange", "title": "Nifex [Crypto exchange]", "description": "Nifex is Cryptocurrency trading platform with key video sharing platform as our marketing tool.\n", "last_update": "2020-08-02T10:48:02.192Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0months ago", "sybil_score": "-1.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/boifagusy", "handle": "boifagusy", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/40f20a65a1a9237ee375a4e42c7d2834/boifagusy.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]], "last_clr_calc_date": "21\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "0.0000", "positive_round_contributor_count": 0, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "nifex-crypto-exchange", "url": "/grants/965/nifex-crypto-exchange", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x5f2435C5d2337EC304A6e5961AC4dbB2b08ACD82", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": false}, {"id": 968, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/2833ceb2646e814e43ac1f9ef8921fb8/dshakle_logo.png", "details_url": "/grants/968/dshackle-fault-tolerant-load-balancer-for-ethereu", "title": "Dshackle - Fault Tolerant Load Balancer for Ethereum API", "description": "Dshackle provides a high level aggregated API on top of several underlying upstreams.

This container must be stored securely, shared upon request, and managed only by an individual. The implementation of where to keep such worthy information might vary, but the\u00a0Distributed Ledger (Blockchain)\u00a0looks the most prominent.\n\nThe simple implementation case would look like: several fields containing personal data are stored in Blockchain, and encrypted by the person\u2019s private key (this is one of the pain points for a lot of people, they get overwhelmed by 'all the keys'), making it cryptographically tamper resistant or unable to be accessed from anywhere in any form without that key. \n\n*External parties can access only the data needed, and\u00a0only upon the key holder\u2019s approval. This will incentivize people having correct data and enable people to incorporate their 'identity profile' wherever they like and get paid for it!\n\nHere's an example: if identity metadata knows enough to calculate the\u00a0personal risk profile\u00a0and is used for the\u00a0risk underwriting, we come to the unique concept of\u00a0self-sovereign risk.\n\nSelf-sovereign risk is a sub-category or self-sovereign identity; hence inheritance of its advantages: it\u2019s kept guarded by an individual, can be mutually filled, and partially shared by its master.\n\nMutualization of risk: risk is supplied by multiple parties that are sanctioned by the risk profile owner. The party might be a legal authority, or some organization (the gym, doctor, your job), or an IoT device (health tracker, your car). The mutual result will have lower redundancy in the digital profile and complete in comparison to traditional methods.\n\nTransactional risk: owners can share or transact a part of their own risk. Upon request, some data is shared with an interested party (insurer or a business partner) if/when the holder wants.\n\nThe two above result is somewhat new and crazy use cases. For instance, the risk profile might be used as a form of trust for a \u2018voting power,\u2019 allowing the holder to take an acting role in the insurance claim resolution or other managing function. Or, letting a parent who carries high trust due to his driving behavior vouching for their kids and cutting down their monthly premium. Or, allowing a group of friends to add to a shared risk pool and build up a trusted community with the financial benefit of each participant. Or, you use your own\u00a0transactable risk as a form of collateral asset, which gets locked (and possibly even burned) in return for another digital asset.\n\nFinally, there might be a form of\u00a0DeFi\u00a0(Decentralized Finance) instrument that generates a substantial profit as a return for the invested risk.\nAt the very least, the self-sovereign risk will lead to a better/cheaper custom-tailored pricing model for an individual. Additionally, fearless security with no dependence on FAANG or any other third-party datacenter.\n\nThe risk carriers will have a live helicopter view on their customers\u2019 base risk, allowing them to run the financial reports ad-hoc. In fact, customers don\u2019t have to reveal much data for businesses to analyze risks \u2018en masse.\u2019\u00a0Instead, Blockchain storage can have a zero-knowledge principle embedded, disclosing only \u2018conditional\u2019 datasets and these datasets are only tied to an address with a key. All these might be rather a game-changer for the regulatory reporting and Solvency regulation.\n\nAudibility and controls around contracts better support and enables the multinational law.\n\nExample:\nThe TokenStake contract serves as an abstract interface. It provides four functions: two functions for staking and two functions for releasing:\n \ncontract TokenStake { \n\tfunction stakeFor(address _staker, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) ; \n\tfunction stake(uint256 _value) internal returns (bool); \n\tfunction releaseFor(address _beneficiary, uint _value) internal returns (bool); \n\tfunction release(uint _value) internal returns (bool);\n}\u00a0\n\nThe staking functions are public, anyone can transfer tokens to the contract. To notify the contract about the incoming tokens, this has to be done in two steps: \n\n\t1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The token owner approves the TokenStake contract over the sum of tokens to be staked. \n\t2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The token owner calls stake or stakeFor. \n\nThe TokenStake contract then transfers the token to the TokenStake contract and records the tokens in an internal ledger. The release functions are internal, therefore the TokenStake contract itself has not much utility: If you transfer tokens to the original TokenStake contract, the tokens will be locked forever. \n\nThe TokenStake contract becomes useful if you extend it with some additional logic, which binds the release functions to some condition. This condition can be arbitrarily implemented. A typical use would be a time lock: the release function can be called after a certain block or time is reached. As a more complex example, we present another use case where the TokenStake contract is used to reward an oracle for providing the information in due time. First, we present the basic skeleton of a blockchain oracle.\n\nA contract using this oracle will extend this interface. It will then call query() with a string containing the actual request (e.g. a HTTP URL with an API call, or an SQL query). The actual oracle will watch the Query event, perform the query off-chain, and then call __callback with the result. The id parameter is used to discriminate parallel calls to the oracle. \n\ncontract usingOracle {\n\tevent Query(string _request, bytes32 _id);\n\tuint256 count;\n\tfunction query(string _request) internal returns (uint256) {\\\n\t\tcount += 1;\n\t\tQuery(string _request, id);\n\t\treturn count;\n\t}\n\tfunction __callback(string _result, uint256 _id) public {\n\n\t}\n}\n\n\nWe can now extend this basic interface with a reward mechanism: the oracle receives 10 tokens for each __callback which is performed within 15 minutes of the respective query and we plan to come up with a better bonus schedule and work with some additional partners in this space:\n\ncontract usingIncentivizedOracle is usingOracle, TokenStake { \n\tmapping(uint256 => uint256) public deadlines; \n\tuint256 deadline constant = 30 minutes; \n\taddress constant contractor = 0x1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd; \n\tuint256 constant reward = 10; \n\t\n\tfunction query(string _request) internal returns (bytes32 _id) { \n\t\t_id = super.oraclize_query(_request); \n\t\tdeadlines[_id] = now + deadline; return _id;\n\t}\n\n\tfunction __callback(bytes32 id, string _result) public {\n\t\tif (now < deadlines[id]) {\n\t\t\treleaseFor(contractor, reward);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\u00a0\n\nFinally, we put everything together in a simple insurance contract. We assume that somebody has already approved the insurance for the transfer of a number of tokens. In case of a timely delivery of the request, the oracle (with address contractor) receives 10 tokens. The oracle - simplified - checks the \u201cforecast\u201d data and yields \u201cOK\u201d if the area can be insured.\n\ncontract Insurance is usingIncentivizedProxy { \n\n\tfunction Insurance (uint256 _stakedTokens) { \n\t\tstake(_stakedTokens); \n\t} \n\n\tfunction newPolicy(string _forecast) public { \n\t\tid = query(_forecast);\n\t\t// store policy, \u2026 perform further checks ... \n\t}\n\n\tfunction __callback(uint256 _id, string _result) public { \n\t\tsuper.__callback(_id, _result); \n\t\tif (_result == \u2018ok\u2019) { \n\t\t\tunderwrite(_id, _result);\n\t\t\t// notify customer that the policy has been accepted. \n\t\t} \n\t} \n}\u00a0\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-10T13:29:51.321Z", "last_update_natural": "3\u00a0weeks ago", "sybil_score": "-1.0000",

\"AAVEX\" which is an aTokens exchange leveraging on the Bancor Nerwork swap mechanism allowing double AMM yield for liquidity providers. \n\nTaking advantage of bancor V2 new design that solves the dirty little secret of the AMMs more known as \"impermanent loss\" and Aave lending platform, the implemented dapp will allow LPs to:\n\nEarn Aave interests.\nEarn Bancor trading fees\nAllow Single-Token Exposure.\nAmplified Liquidity.\nAnd all this without impermanent loss.\n\nThis project will implement custom AMM based on bancor new design and add them to the already deployed bancor network, all the tokens deposited through the customs pools will be sent to Aave and the minted aTokens will be kept by the pool.\n\nTechnical aspects\n\nThe users providing liquidity in the custom pools will receive a double yield from Bancor trading fees and Aave interest earnings without suffering from any impermanent loss since the new design based on Chainlink oracle will be used. A liquidity providers allowing X amount of tokens to the custom pool will also provide that same amount to Aave. \n\nThe custom pool will not implement any mechanism to borrow funds since the fund will be moved around when a swap occurs.\n\nA single pool KNC/BNT will allow trading on KNC/aKNC/BNT, this will increase the pool tradings fees since more swap path are enabled.\n\nIf a users judge that the token swap mechanism is more expensive since we are making extra steps by depositing to Aave or withdrawing from it, he can always use the aToken pair, for example instead of swapping BNT/KNC the user can choose BNT/aKNC wich will avoid interacting with aave and reduce the transactions fees.\n\nThe new Bancor design indirectly eliminated a major issue of the custom pool design, in case if all the liquidity in Aave is borrowed and swapping through the custom pool won't be possible, once the borrowers pay back their loans and fees there will be no arbitrage opportunity since the Chainlink oracle will fill that gap buy just setting the latest prices.\n\nTake a Look\n\nA beta v1 demo is available in https://aavex.decentrify.io, v1 custom pool does not implement the new Bancor features yet.\n\nFunding \n\nThe funding will:\n\n- Help set up a team.\n- Create bounties to upgrade the UX/UI.\n- Build & deploy the solidity contracts.\n- Create and build a decentralized incentivize model based on staking pool tokens for the initial liquidity providers, where a minimum of 40% of the project generated fees will be paid to the LPs.\n- Help the project to kickstart and create a marketing campaign.\n", "last_update": "2020-07-09T00:40:08.998Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0months, 3\u00a0weeks ago", "sybil_score": "-1.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000",

Technology allows individuals to control data privacy and data ownership by default. Web3 also introduced a decentralized Internet, where rent-seeking third parties have less control over user interaction and value transfer.\n\nThe Internet, the global economy and the government have not yet fully realized the vision of Web3. Nevertheless, in 2019, the paradigm shift has been going smoothly. Significant progress has been made in solving these technical challenges through innovative solutions, and the vision of Web3 as a true competitor to Web2 is nearing realization.\n\nWhat value will be generated in the Web3 world?

Rinkeby Version: Here, I plan to link the wallet in backend so people do not even need to deal with wallets and all, this enables people unfamiliar to blockchain space, directly try out the space and send messages.\u00a0\n\n\tVersions : mobile compatibility / embedded version, message only version, view only art version, mixed, public installation version.\n\n\tOnchain Embedding (Images, Pdfs, Files etc)\n\tGrandma friendly interface to embed immutable pictures, files and more. (experimentation with directly on chain or ipfs/ filecoin).\n\u00a0\nMid-term:\n\u00a0\n\tGraphics!!!\n\t Wrapping the initial space with appealing graphics: Interactive shaders, organic-cyberpunk visuals(concept dev), HDRP + Optimizations for web.\n \n\tExpos, Public Installations\u00a0\n\tIts about spreading the awareness! + Website, Marketing, Academic Research: on community interaction/platform/ outcomes.\n\tBug fixes, extra language font support, feedback mods and fixes.\n\n \n There is no tokenomics involved and is purely an artform and a platform directly on eth to spread the awareness, from a pure space of passion and love for blockchain, decentralization, cryptosphere, equality and freedom of speech. \n \n \n\u00a0\nPossible Long Term: \nI have some further ideas with gamification of the space, such as an interactive multiplayer platform inside the verse(diamond-eth logo), - mini games or virtual festivals or community art gallery etc. There are also some thoughts around crosschain NFT\u2019s or cross platform transitions and collaboration with other forms of blockchain art and games. And some great mechanics, physics systems and ideas with the verse which co-relates with the outside message blocks(note, as you\u00a0may see in pitch video, when one sends a message, a block spawns, which lifts the verse). Though more on this after initial mid-term goals \ud83d\ude0a , If it kicks off really well, I have some amazing game dev peers to bring onboard and ofcourse the great online global community.\n\u00a0\nAkashik is ofc open source:\u00a0https://github.com/AkashickVerse\n \n\nOpen to feedback, suggestion, criticism or thoughts, please feel free to comment or write to me personally at akashick@embracingearth.space\n \n About the Creator: \nSahaj Garg is a new media artist, developer and experimenter.

Also Crypto-Bullions allow you to be long or short with exposure to multiple assets at the same time. Allowing for a vast rich new set of crypto derivatives. Taking advantage of timestamps in the Ethereum blockchain, users can use the full nature of crypto to unlock time-locked vaulted bullions. Time-Locked vaulted bullions can mint Species, while also be used in confidentiality to sell at a specific time for whatever the user chooses as the specific monetary value. This allows for unique growth and scaling of Finance 2.0 tools in a decentralized way.\u00a0Crypto-Bullions are the modern way of taking an old financial instrument and unlocking its Web 3.0 value.\n\n\n", "last_update": "2020-08-19T00:47:23.484Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0month, 1\u00a0week ago", "sybil_score": "-1.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/coreytmayweather", "handle": "coreytmayweather", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/360721aa91b6d1be3aa429c1ecd30e02/coreytmayweather.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]], "last_clr_calc_date": "22\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "0.0000", "positive_round_contributor_count": 0, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "specie-a-decentralized-bullion-coin-minter", "url": "/grants/1024/specie-a-decentralized-bullion-coin-minter", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "DAI", "admin_address": "specie.eth", "token_address": "0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F", "image_css": "", "verified": false}, {"id": 1031, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/e60872e7675de427ed91d8e7331ea4e8/logo.svg", "details_url": "/grants/1031/daocare", "title": "dao.care", "description": "How it works?\r\n1- Join the fund\r\nDeposit DAI into the fund to be part of the DAO.

DFAME - Your social app with creator stocks", "description": "Description\nDFAME enables creators, brands, artists, or influencers to turn their community into an economy. Users join in by owning the community tokens which grants them rights to media content as well as the ability to collaborate within the community. The creator's community becomes its own network and tokens represent new value creation distributed amongst all members.\n\nOur Vision is to help the creative and lifestyle industry to fix their value creation by enabling creators to have full control over their content and its monetization. On the other side, from a user perspective, we want to create a new way of interaction between creators and their audiences by giving the possibility to have a stake in the creator's value. DFAME's vision is to lead a new era of value creation within the digital community and disrupt the creator follower relationship.\n\n\nHow It's Made\nIt's built around 3box and ipfs for both user profiles as well as storing video data. The frontend uses React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS to build a lightweight client. We integrate with TryRoll for token minting and wallet integration, and we use Abridged for efficient layer 2 erc20 transactions.\n\nAn Introduction into DFAME\n\nWatch an Introduction video\n\nWatch a Full App runthrough\n\nLive DEMO: https://dfame.collab.land/\n\nCheck us out!\nWebsite - https://www.dfame.app/ \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/dfame_app\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/yqA4FG\nMedium - https://medium.com/dfame\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-21T09:01:49.403Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 3\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-2.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/cyan-one", "handle": "cyan-one", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/acb67938b2ef9939105095689e258e9c/simonweniger.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 6.36290227936156, 0.0], [1.0, 10.0122004040184, 3.64929812465688], [10.0, 13.8283556259805, 7.46545334661895], [100.0, 17.6135052322865, 11.250602952925], [1000.0, 19.8195624294937, 13.4566601501321], [10000.0, 20.7231535752172, 14.3602512958556]], "last_clr_calc_date": "23\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "13.3000", "positive_round_contributor_count": 5, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "dfame-your-social-app-with-creator-stocks", "url": "/grants/1051/dfame-your-social-app-with-creator-stocks", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "DAI", "admin_address": "0x684D30c3504fEa374fC21ecBaf1A5D86E4eee278", "token_address": "0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1052, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/eff17831920e31e88abe454095a9856a/wildcards-logo-square.svg", "details_url": "/grants/1052/wildcards", "title": "Wildcards", "description": "Thank you to everyone that supports our grant!

(How much time does it take to find who to donate to? Do you know or have confidence where the money is being used? Do you remember to keep donating regularly? Do you feel the generic \"thank you\" email is sufficient acknowledgement (personally and publicly)?)\n\nWildcards connects endangered animal conservations and donator's directly through a fun and engaging platform via a recurring revenue model.\u00a0\n\nDonators purchase digital endangered animals that are verifiably unique by the blockchain which are always for sale this means that when a user purchases a wildcard they are instantly required to set a selling price.\n\nThe owner is incentivised not to raise the price too high because they pay a percentage of their sale price to hold the animal, and these funds are continually generated for endangered animal conservation.\n\nWildcards is the first (and only?) scalable Harberger tax system deployed on mainnet ethereum. Scalable in the sense that a smartcontract manages the multiple NFTs and so users can own and pay for multiple tokens with the same deposit shared between them. And thus Wildcards can be thought of as the first \"patronage market\" on Ethereum.\n\nHere is our presentation from ethCC in March.\nHere is our presentation update with integrating Matic\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-16T19:16:35.738Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks ago", "sybil_score": "-1.8750", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "MATIC", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/denhampreen", "handle": "denhampreen", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/48ff18ee32eb5ecdfe8c5a03ca1ab69a/denhampreen.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 219.108052712058, 0.0], [1.0, 240.25213138997, 21.1440786779123], [10.0, 260.940613656173, 41.8325609441155], [100.0, 281.116709411252, 62.0086566991943], [1000.0, 293.133922276985, 74.0258695649277], [10000.0, 298.186571552978, 79.0785188409209]], "last_clr_calc_date": "a minute ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "18\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "62.2664", "positive_round_contributor_count": 16, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "wildcards", "url": "/grants/1052/wildcards", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x7710c1A75B9a9D67abC493a08CA6507Dc42c6a11", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1055, "logo_url": "https://s.gitcoin.co/static/v2/images/grants/logos/2.f816a629d2de.png", "details_url": "/grants/1055/sentinel", "title": "Sentinel", "description": "Sentinel is a Decentralized Application for secure storage of crime records.

This is only going to get worse.\n\nWe are building the chain of custody for all digital content ie. tools that allow anyone to verify the origin, history and context of everything they see online.\n\nWho are we?\n\nThis project has been developed & self-funded until now with a team of 6 remote developers & researchers from diverse backgrounds, experiences & expertise.We recently we got accepted into a berlin-based accelerator which would allow us to scale & launch this tool, however due to the current scenario we haven't been able to capitalise on this. \n\nOur current roadmap is geared for launch pre US Elections in november, and the funding received will be used as follows:\n\nInfrastructure scaling\nMarketing for B2C product\nSupporting full-time developers\nEducation & Community building (in 3rd world countries where education is lacking but everyone has a smartphone)\n\n\n\nDeeper look at our product\n\nContent Registry\nWe have developed proprietary AI driven web crawlers with built in optimisation heuristics, tailored to scouring for content across the internet. Along with this, our system is monitoring for real-time feeds of events happening across the world through major publishers & social media channels.\n\nOrganon (Analytics Engine)\nWe realised earlier on that the approach to solve this problem would have to be cross-medial ie. analysing both content and the context it\u2019s used in. Our analytics engine provides this on two parallel layers:\nContent Analysis\n\nSynthetic & modified media has been rampant on the internet over the last few years. The content analytical engine utilises advanced fingerprinting algorithms & state-of-the-art Machine vision techniques to provide a way to discern modifications, detect deepfakes & synthetic media.\nContext Analysis\n\nThe analysis of content alone is not enough; sometimes content can be used in a different situation than it was first presented, or the text accompanying the content has inherent biases, disputed facts or misleading connections. Our Context analytical engine uses cutting-edge Natural language Processing techniques to highlight these & also provide an insight into the why, which means highlighting socio-economic events that would have lead to different narratives around similar content. Having tracked a content through its distribution lifecycle, our engine shows the chain of custody, publisher\u2019s trust score & other relevant metrics.\n\nInfrastructure Suite & Apps\nOur provenance browser plugin utilises this infrastructure to provide analysis on articles being read by the user.\nSince there are a wide-array of applications that can benefit from our infrastructure, we will also have an API for 3rd party applications to utilise and build other truth-based products examples:\nSoftware that helps publishers automate fact checking.\nTools for social networks to flag suspicious or disputed content. Tools for creators to track usage of their intellectual property.\n\n\nContact us at hello@edjo.io if you have any questions or would like to help us on our mission.\n", "last_update": "2020-08-17T14:11:50.522Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0month, 2\u00a0weeks ago", "sybil_score": "-1.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "INFRA TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/excerebrose", "handle": "excerebrose", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/ffa68354a76d043f0087e4c335ce13de/excerebrose.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]], "last_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "15\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "0.0000", "positive_round_contributor_count": 0, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "provenance-the-truth-layer-of-the-internet", "url": "/grants/1065/provenance-the-truth-layer-of-the-internet", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xAD905c42ede3A50Af77d3393F00b7699219E68b0", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": false}, {"id": 1067, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/c2224ffbbdeba73b3428c4f409570893/Logo1.png", "details_url": "/grants/1067/moneygamesinfo", "title": "MoneyGames.info", "description": "MoneyGames.info\n\nWhat: Our mission is to create a resource for those who are interested in learning more about Ethereum Money games. We hope MoneyGames.info will serve as a guide, explorer, and news source for those who are interested in Ethereum Money games. In addition, we hope to help evaluate the legitimacy of the varying Money Games by eventually creating a Money Games rating system.\n\nWhy: We believe Money Games will be a significant part of the new financial landscape that Ethereum is building. At the moment, the number of Money Game players is small and concentrated. While we believe we can be a great resource for serious Money Game players, we also hope to be a bridge to help bring non-crypto users into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nGoal: Build a trusted source of Ethereum Money Games information.\n\nDevelopment Plan\nOur goal to raise a grant for each individual phase of development. Ideally, we start with a small grant, then build out from there as the community of supporters verifies the completion of each phase. This will allow us to take feedback along the way and adjust accordingly.\n\nPhase 1 ($1,000): Acquire relevant domain names, develop a brand for MoneyGames.info, design a basic shell for the website and load with a few of the current Money Games, launch MoneyGames.info. \n\nPhase 2: If phase 1 is successful (phase 1 grant raised and phase 1 completed), we will then launch a phase 2 grant that will aim to bring the entire Money Games ecosystem into MoneyGames.info. \n\nPhase 3: After a successful phase 2, we then begin offering commentary on the current Money Games landscape (macro and micro). This will include articles, videos, and guest writers. Possibly an additional paid content creator.\n\nPhase 4: Create the Money Games rating system.\n\nWho Am I?\nI\u2019m like a combination of Herm Edwards and Doug Funny. And, I don\u2019t like to talk about my anon self. See my comments on Twitter I suppose. But, I will say, I am an avid fan and user of Ethereum, and have been for the past 3-4 years. I love to build things; pergolas, relationships, brands, websites, communities\u2026those sorts of things. \n\nI\u2019m looking for where I can add value to this amazing Ethereum community, and building MoneyGames.info is the way for me to do that.\n\nCheers!\n", "last_update": "2020-08-17T17:02:25.135Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0month, 2\u00a0weeks ago", "sybil_score": "-5.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/westcoastwalker", "handle": "westcoastwalker", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/57fb5133057cdce8b30d1a9ace04dde3/westcoastwalker.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.74914358269857, 0.74914358269857], [10.0, 1.73293283102832, 1.73293283102832], [100.0, 2.96367744206287, 2.96367744206287], [1000.0, 3.82206721188869, 3.82206721188869], [10000.0, 4.20743070561663, 4.20743070561663]], "last_clr_calc_date": "13\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "6\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "0.9500", "positive_round_contributor_count": 1, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "moneygamesinfo", "url": "/grants/1067/moneygamesinfo", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "DAI", "admin_address": "0xBbd78448570Dd5D0CE7DA76903433D8D5d38bE09", "token_address": "0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1070, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/48a3ebb4e8ac35276d2fe521ab1c1b37/cloud_native_1.svg", "details_url": "/grants/1070/kotal-multi-client-cloud-agnostic-blockchain-infr", "title": "Kotal: Multi-client cloud-agnostic Blockchain infrastructure deployer.", "description": "Kotal\n \nKotal is an opensource multi-client cloud-agnostic blockchain infrastructure deployer that makes it easy to deploy highly available, self-managing, self-healing Blockchain infrastructure like networks, nodes, beacon nodes, validator nodes on any cloud.\n\nWhat can I do with Kotal ?\n\nDeploy highly available multi-client blokchain networks and nodes\nJoin public networks like Ethereum or Bitcoin Mainnet\nJoin test networks like Rinkeby, Ropsten or Goerli\nLaunch your own validator node\nCreate and join private consortium networks\nCreate decentralized storage cluster\nBe your own infura\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-19T23:13:20.003Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 4\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-1.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "INFRA TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/mfarghaly", "handle": "mfarghaly", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/a266f49e90cd078e58aaad01f39aa917/mfarghaly.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.482265150901404, 0.0], [1.0, 2.62835525361652, 2.14609010271512], [10.0, 4.84901695408927, 4.36675180318787], [100.0, 7.10505399483244, 6.62278884393103], [1000.0, 8.47782802314772, 7.99556287224632], [10000.0, 9.05754029498463, 8.57527514408322]], "last_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "15\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "5.7000", "positive_round_contributor_count": 2, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "kotal-multi-client-cloud-agnostic-blockchain-infr", "url": "/grants/1070/kotal-multi-client-cloud-agnostic-blockchain-infr", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x5dfA5dB515748f3E2BCc8677A9332f4aFFad5A5E", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1071, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/484ec5a7009d6215bcd2a79213e90c58/always-for-sale-sq.png", "details_url": "/grants/1071/alwaysforsaleio", "title": "AlwaysForSale.io", "description": "What\r\n\r\nalwaysforsale allows anyone to put their art on display in any of our premium gallery spots, at any point in time.\r\n\r\nHow\r\n\r\nEach gallery spot has a price.

"JUSD: Profitable Stablecoin for DeFi", "description": "JCent Protocol\n\nJcent protocol is an innovative experimental stable currency protocol. Users can use JCent approved assets as collateral to generate stable currency JUSD. Second, JCent protocol maintains a decentralized JEN native asset pool. The assets of the asset pool belong to the protocol itself. Users can borrow just from this pool, and the lending process is implemented by JCent DAO management, the income generated is owned by the entire JCent protocol, and the income distribution is managed by JCent DAO, and is organized and operated by the community.\n\nJcent protocol is a kind of encryption protocol similar to MakerDao and JST. The biggest innovation of JCent is that JCent maintains a decentralized native asset pool, which is owned by all JEN holders and managed by the JEN holder community.\n\nHowever, only stable currency assets mapped by JEN can be lent from JEN pool. Users use a certain proportion of assets as collateral. If JEN drops, the system will clear the user's collateral and destroy the JUSD Lended. Therefore, just can maintain a 1:1 stability with the value of US dollars.\n\nStable Coin JUSD\n\nThe stable currency JUSD is an asset-backed cryptocurrency that anchors the US dollar. Its issuance is decentralized and managed by JCent DAO.\n\nJUSD is generated and issued by JCent protocol. Users can issue a certain proportion of just as long as they mortgage enough assets as security. In order to keep the JUSD value equal to the US dollar, users need to over mortgage certain digital assets.\n\nThe JCent protocol maintains a certain proportion of native assets issued from the system asset pool. Users can borrow JUSD from this pool.\n\nGovernance\n\nJCent governance is entirely up to the JEN holder. However, in the early stage, we will reserve some permissions to help JCent protocol run stably. After it is completely stable, the ownership of all JEN protocol contracts will be transferred to the time locked governance contract or completely deleted. To ensure that JCent is a reference implementation of a truly decentralized protocol.\n\nMore Information\nTelegram\nTwitter\nGithub\n", "last_update": "2020-08-24T01:29:08.582Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0month, 1\u00a0week ago", "sybil_score": "-1.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/walkerhex", "handle": "walkerhex", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/a03f4f91f1efaa4dbeeb5553fedd2564/walkerhex.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]], "last_clr_calc_date": "23\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "0.0000", "positive_round_contributor_count": 0, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "jusd-profitable-stablecoin-for-defi", "url": "/grants/1079/jusd-profitable-stablecoin-for-defi", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xE30209ADe7A634409CAa133B33382D877031D800", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": false}, {"id": 1080, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/98a44f1cdec784f57440edef9720aef4/Treejer_Logo_n.png", "details_url": "/grants/1080/treejer-a-climate-action-protocol", "title": "Treejer: A Climate Action Protocol", "description": "Treejer\u00a0(tr\u0113\u0292\u0259r) is an open-source and forest-based climate action protocol powered by blockchain technology.

The idea behind Atlas Library System is simple - to help Authors directly control their income and at the same time curb the issue of intellectual property theft\u00a0by making e-books available for rent at an affordable price. \n\u00a0\nDApp Workflow & Process:\nAtlas Library System deploys Ethereum smart contracts using MaticVigil APIs. ALS also uses Sia's Skynet Portal for E-Book storage and an upgraded ERC20 contract as the as the asset contract for token management. \n\u00a0\nUpon signing up for the very first time, a deterministic Ethereum address is enerated through the user's email and a fixed salt, which is essentially a representation of the user's address.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThrough the account section, users can purchase ALT (Atlas Library Tokens) with the help of a simple payment gateway (presently designed for the Indian subcontinent). Using these tokens, the user can rent e-books for any time duration. The rental time durations are stored on the chain and the ALT spent by users is temporarily held by a smart contract to be later redistributed to the Authors.\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, any user can upgrade their account to become an author for free. With an author account, users can upload e-books which sent to the admin for review. Once approved, the e-books are available in the library to be rented by others users and Author's receive the income. \n\u00a0\nThe entire DApp is wrapped in a slick and simple user interface which makes the user experience intuitive and hassle-free. \n", "last_update": "2020-09-17T15:47:10.885Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 6\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "0.1111", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0744", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "MATIC", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/aditya-vijaykumar", "handle": "aditya-vijaykumar", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/e0e02dfd548e61e878922deba542f8b6/aditya-vijaykumar.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 40.9171446450686, 0.0], [1.0, 51.0204114079212, 10.1032667628526], [10.0, 61.9489946024923, 21.0318499574237], [100.0, 73.8870314422153, 32.9698867971467], [1000.0, 81.6636219492167, 40.7464773041482], [10000.0, 85.0816503581246, 44.164505713056]], "last_clr_calc_date": "a minute ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "18\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "24.4955", "positive_round_contributor_count": 9, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "atlas-library-system", "url": "/grants/1082/atlas-library-system", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x51749838f13248E550a8F76D1F34Fc26d3609D77", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1084, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/b53a5eceaa9a3790d98f3f6b1bf82e61/live_like_poster.png", "details_url": "/grants/1084/live-like", "title": "Live-Like", "description": "The Live-Like project aim to decentralize live streaming.

The result of this algorithm is called the Information Waterfall.\nBy having a higher PARETO Score\u2122 a trader can act on valuable information before people with lower scores, giving them a significant advantage.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Intel providers are rewarded based on the quality of their information :\nUpon receiving the intel, traders reward the information based on its quality. As a result, intel providers earn and generate revenue.\nIntel providers\u00a0are therefore incentivized to provide quality information to the network, as they can profit more than if they acted on it alone.\nTraders\u00a0make decisions from early and accurate information and they reward the contributor of the intel, as this allows the trader to receive new intel earlier.\nThe platform aims to ensure that everyone gets paid.\n\nPareto provides a current, reputable & actionable intel for traders and investors.

This grant will serve as the matching fund to pilot our (quadratic funding with smart contract milestones) crowdfunding platform to support early stage startups in emerging markets. \n\nAbout Rare Birds\nJo-Ann started the Rare Birds platform as podcast, newsletter and community. After conducting over 150 interviews with startup founders from across emerging markets it became clear to her that funding was a big problem. To solve this problem she started researching blockchain technology and realised there was massive potential to provide alternate funding to startups to assist them in helping them scale their projects. She joined Gitcoin's KERNEL where she met Awosika, Milensu and Sonia, they all joined forces to create #TeamRareBirds, a collaborative group with a strong interest to see startups glean funding. Whilst in KERNEL they learned about quadratic funding and started exploring how they could incorporate it into the crowdfund model. \n\nWhy Crowdfunding\n\nCrowdfunding has proven to be an alternative and successful way to secure funding in the Western world. It's presence is still in its infancy in emerging markets but research show the potential is huge. #TeamRareBirds decided to pursue the quadratic funding model after seeing the success of Downtown Stimulus, however with one change, built in milestones with smart contracts to ensure backers are empowered to support projects and provide transparency to the funding system. In addition to this the trubudget blockchain workflow will be implemented to ensure all stakeholders are able to manage and contribute to the success of each project. \n\n#TeamRareBirds believes that funding startups in emerging markets is a public good and that ensuring founders are able to receive monies to help further their high impact projects brings larger benefits to communities that are often lacking resources and opportunitities.\n\nPilot\n\nWe are now seeking funding to pilot our project and to test our assumptions and ascertain whether our product is a fit. We are also seeking supporters to generally support and champion the startups in our community. We are asking you to lend your support to see early stage startups grow! \n\nPlease reach out to us via Twitter @RareBirdsHQ_ if you have further questions. \n\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-19T07:41:05.476Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 5\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-2.3333", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/jalexandrah", "handle": "jalexandrah", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/6e638ed45bea30d2da48f7c2d7667394/jalexandrah.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 3.86765947875659, 0.0], [1.0, 7.47192140488754, 3.60426192613095], [10.0, 9.67404301456911, 5.80638353581252], [100.0, 11.395743493195, 7.52808401443838], [1000.0, 12.2654259281641, 8.3977664494075], [10000.0, 12.5973697490883, 8.72971027033173]], "last_clr_calc_date": "24\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "92.3734", "positive_round_contributor_count": 3, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "rare-birds", "url": "/grants/1105/rare-birds", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "WETH", "admin_address": "0xA1e4052bdF596b9272f4AF6c0e97957a251Db3a1", "token_address": "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1106, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/fccf04ce719f59d1e266f18100ee5d9b/GodMode_Logo_400x400.png", "details_url": "/grants/1106/godmode", "title": "GodMode", "description": "Create and manipulate copies of the DeFi ecosystem in order to model risk scenarios.

Once you have completed filling out the selection of DApps and services you use. A .txt file is generated that allows you to edit, print and then hand write the private details required for your beneficiaries to access your address/ wallets. This document should be kept as safe as your seed phrase as it is a literal \"how to guide\" on accessing all of your Ethereum based assets. This is a free service for the community to use.\n\nI couldn't find anything that would do this for my own needs so I created it and thought it may be useful for other folk too. It seems to be a topic that people don't really talk about it. This is by no means an optimal solution (I have ideas for that!) but it is at least a start and gets people thinking and talking about what will happen to their Ethereum based assets when they die.\n\nHere is a video of me explaining how to use Eth-ter-I-Die\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KgFR8qJ2E80\n\nHere is a video of me explaining more about Eth-ter-I-Die for way to long...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ucMwEc9NpK4\n\nHelp me produce something that could eventually help the ones you love :) \n\n\nHow will the Funds be spent?\nObviously all the funds will be reinvested into the running and development of Eth-ter-I-Die. In the interest of transparency, I will dedicate an area of the website where I will explain how the Gitcoin grant will be spent with every transaction of the used grant explained. The main focus for the funds will be.\n\nGitcoin grants for optimising and further development of the code\nGitcoin grants for improving and maintaining the files\nTranslation services for the files\nDecentralisation\nFuture proofing\n\n\nRoadmap\n\nHere are some planned feature to Eth-ter-I-Die for the short and long term. I am constantly developing and adding new guides as and when i get the time and chipping away at the longer term goals.\n\nShort Term\n\t\t\nAdd more DApp and Service instructions!\nImprove consistency, grammar and clarification of existing instructions\n\nLong Term\nMake decentralised (currently hosted on GitHub Pages...)\nAdd multi- Language Support\nAdd \"Create Dapp Instructions submission\" form\nAdd \"Connect Wallet\" feature to scrape all current asset info from your address and produce a document accordingly\n\nLonger Term \nResearch and develop optimal and dynamic solution for beneficiaries to be able to access your Ethereum based assets. \nThe current Eth-ter-I-Die method is not dynamic, for example if you find a new DApp/ Service you invest in after you create the Eth-ter-I-Die document and then pass away those funds would be lost. An ideal solution would be able to catch that. I have ideas but these need to be developed.\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-28T04:01:39.684Z", "last_update_natural": "3\u00a0days, 9\u00a0hours ago", "sybil_score": "-0.3333", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/lu-calm", "handle": "lu-calm", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/453f4c2c480b01184642636a96cbd98e/lu-calm.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 5.9254461606586, 0.0], [1.0, 9.3690837437762, 3.4436375831176], [10.0, 11.852850559329, 5.9274043986704], [100.0, 13.6044542718816, 7.67900811122302], [1000.0, 14.3960723067104, 8.47062614605182], [10000.0, 14.6815246653873, 8.75607850472872]], "last_clr_calc_date": "24\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "26.7447", "positive_round_contributor_count": 3, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "eth-ter-i-die", "url": "/grants/1119/eth-ter-i-die", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xa28910BcBe9a1b9119940343C02CAE65c1B22cc5", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1121, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/8ec16944329282bb91b0c78a46f9e666/COmplete_logo_gitcoin_grant.jpeg", "details_url": "/grants/1121/integrate-bitski-wallet-support-on-gnosis-safe-wi", "title": "Integrate bitski wallet support on gnosis safe with onboard.js", "description": "Hello and welcome.\n\nI have almost no programming experience whatsoever, so I am of little use in the area of explaining the intricate details of what I would like to have done. \nOn the gnosis safe website I need to be able to select the bitski wallet as an option through the connect a wallet interface and have all the functionality that should come with that.\n\n\nToolbox:\nhttps://www.bitski.com/ ; https://github.com/BitskiCo/bitski-js\nhttps://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/welcome ; https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts\nhttps://docs.blocknative.com/onboard#example-code\n\nI have talked with support in discord and onboard.js should only be required through one of either companies.

Earn Crypto Confidence! The COMPLETELY FREE Crypto Curious Course already empowers Ambassadors in 18 countries to teach blockchain in locations that span a half-dozen languages. By supporting Blockchain Institute with your contribution, you can help us include more people in the decentralized community!\n\nWHO WE ARE\nBlockchain Institute is a 501(c)(3) public charity dedicated to educating the public about blockchains and decentralization. We strive to make learning materials approachable and engaging, no matter where students are on their blockchain journey!\n\nWHAT WE DO\nGiven the lack of financial literacy around the world, there is a large barrier to simply understanding the nature of money and how something like cryptocurrency can exist. We've addressed this through our Crypto Curious Course\u2014a 75-minute education experience targeted at those who \u201chave heard of Bitcoin\u201d and is designed to be taught in a live setting. Following the outbreak of world pandemic, we focused our efforts towards online delivery of this material including webinars. To equip others, we created the Blockchain Ambassador Program to help share the courses and our teaching strategies already helping people all over the world!\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\nWhile we have been exceedingly happy with the success of this first class, we know there is far more to teach people, especially those wanting to learn how to develop smart contracts. As a next step, we are producing a DeFi class with scores of illustrations and detailed descriptions, like Crypto Curious Course that precedes it. Our goal is to make decentralized technology straightforward, which will mean taking our established platform and extending it to advance students to the next level of decentralized education.\n\nWHY WE\u2019RE REQUESTING A GRANT\nNow we need your help to take it to the next level! How? The biggest cost is for our team members to produce high-quality and engaging content. This requires a lot of person-hours and not something we can easily automate away to GPT-3 (yet!). With a few more resources, we could re-invest into the local communities with education and promotion materials, as well as offer continued support for instructors. Lastly, we would like to translate this information into a variety of languages and localizations.\n\nWHERE THE FUNDS WOULD GO\nLike many non-profit organizations, we try to find ways to be highly impactful without costing a lot. To accomplish this, we would like to hire a community manager to better support local community initiatives, amplifying the effect of teaching the public about blockchain technology and decentralization. Currently, we have more than enough work to produce the next 2 major classes, but lack the specific expertise to localize, translate, and distribute this free material around the world. Will you help us?\n\u00a0\n\nIn summary: Help us grow the community not only by continuing to provide more blockchain & decentralized education material, but also by growing the community of paid blockchain professionals.\n\nWe also write code: https://github.com/blockchaininstitutechi/\n", "last_update": "2020-09-15T15:49:04.176Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks, 1\u00a0day ago",

We wanted to introduce game developers to the exciting new possibilities when using Web 3.0. \n\n\n\nIt started out as a full multiplayer web game stack, along with a curation of the Web 3.0 technologies and concepts we've worked with for the last 3 years.\n\nSince then Game3.js has been part of Funding the Future, Unitize, Gitcoin's KERNEL Genesis Block\ud83c\udf31 and now Filecoin's APOLLO \ud83d\ude80\n\nWe've added functionalities such as enabling tournaments via smart contracts, a Unity SDK, an NFT minting functionality (The Contractor), and saving game replays via OrbitDB / IPFS. \n\nAs we build more functionalities our vision remains the same: \n\nWe believe we need to bring in more game developers and game designers onto Web 3.0, and to do we so we need to make it as easy as possible for them get into the space.\n\nGame3.js\u00a0aspires to be the game framework that will lead the way \ud83d\udd25\n\nThank you for joining us in this quest! \n\nPlease subscribe to and share our game3.js newsletter.

The collection will be known as the COMPENDIUM, a depository and backup of physical reality as seen and observed on and from Earth, offering truly disruptive access to 3D models for next-to-nothing costs (1/1000th of current paradigm levels) affordable to all, yet available in versions for even the most demanding of applications.\n\nTo seed the COMPENDIUM, individuals submit their models for consideration, side by side with other \"seeders,\" then others in the seedbank community pick the best representation of the real thing - i.e. the seed of the 3D model that will be planted, so to speak. This selection process accomplishes two key goals:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01) Consensus taste-driven decision-making for approving or declining COMPENDIUM entries; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02) Attachment of buying power, voting power, and file share responsibility - another way of saying \"voting for an entry\" is \"investing in the right to share a portion of a model once it is approved\" - if an entry is not selected, those who spent WATER receive SUN as a consolation (this mechanism is TBD)\n\nThe three actors are seeders, planters, and harvesters. These actors are not mutually exclusive; it is our hope and expectation that members of our community will operate in multiple roles throughout the COMPENDIUM as illustrated in our website. Perhaps a more fitting definition would be that any user providing inputs or taking outputs can be considered an actor, and the available actions correspond to a COMPENDIUM\u2019s current persona representing [0],[1], or [2]. The important aspect is that users (actors) can interact as all three personas in any sort of imaginable spectrum between creator and consumer.\n\nVersions can be released in a phased manner to expand COMPENDIUM fields based on community requests or needs AND, with each version, to increase the minimum resolution (polygon count) for all models listed on the database. Raising the bar for resolution with each version release ensures contributors always have fields to fill, creates a model hierarchy and allows for people to only access versions of the COMPENDIUM they can afford OR have a need for (for example, a storyboard artist may have all of their basic needs met with COMPENDIUM 1.0 files, whereas 2.0 or 3.0 might be better suited for a surfacing designer or animator), and the differentiation of versions correlates the value of our primary token to a metric (polygon count) with no theoretical limit THROUGH THE LENS of human taste or aesthetics. So each new version stimulates the economy and could be an opportunity to mediate the economy through changing reward levels version to version.\n\nWhile our competitors put up insurmountable paywalls and hoard freedom of expression, our DApp is unique because we are not financial in nature, and the DApps that are similar to ours (thematically) lack broader unifying visions OR repackage archaic and greedy business models. Certain internet 2.0 competitors tout themselves as marketplaces for rare digital art (both 2D and 3D) and their main pitch is that blockchain proves your ownership. DID SEAN PARKER CHANGE THE WORLD FOREVER BY PROVING THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY OWNED THEIR CDs? No, he f!@#ing made Napster. Unless the \"digital farmscapes\" they are selling for~$900 on certain galleries begin producing literal farm goods for us to print and sell somehow, they can take their precious \"rare\" art and put it in a closet in an abandoned subway station - as more people might see or care about it there. By all odds, the digital art from these sites will only depreciate in value with time. This is as far from \"public good\" as one can stray - overcharging single-case early adopters for something placed behind a pay wall and therefore deemed rare. Hypocrites.\n\nOur project will certainly perform a public good by creating multiple revenue streams for the community, offering educational resources at fractional costs, and undertaking a lofty goal to codify the forms seen on and from Earth. Certainly, this extremely important endeavor could become a non-profit which we would support, but we can investigate our options as the vision becomes more clear and the model suggests it can stand on its own two legs. In any event, the GitCoin grant session we are pursuing is specifically for projects concerning \"public good.\"No one else seems poised to accomplish something of this scale that could augment education and also preserve assets for all of humanity. In contrast to others, we can create income streams in multiple ways for our participants, and in a very real and inartificial way wrap them in a metaphor people can understand, relate to and want to forage with. \n\nLet\u2019s get in front of open and creative people who are clamoring for an interesting DApp to come around that also creates a \u201cpublic asset\u201d and preserves it for humanity. Let's get people excited about life again, about the beauty of the Earth. Let's ensure the base model is a given for the next generation of creatives, artists and engineers and their ideas don't perish climbing a paywall. Let's collect the seeds we will use to plant and supplant reality - where world building itself could become a part of a stack. If life on Earth were to face damning threats, whether external ones like asteroid impacts or internal ones like total nuclear war, the COMPENDIUM could be exported, stored or sent out into space at any time. All of the proof of the wonders of life and its evolutions that this planet witnessed, the toilings of millenia, preserved on a single chain.\n\u00a0\nSincerely,\nDruid, Shaman, & Paladin\n\nUpdate 9/15: We aim to provide a github link soon with loose contract structures and descriptions of mechanisms as they pertain to fungibility vs non amongst SEED, WATER, and SUN. SUN becomes WATER over time. SUN regulates voting and provides losing investors with additional skin in the game. WATER flows as voting power and buying power. SEED is scattered amongst investors like a p2p file share network. Harvesters (outside consumers) use WATER to get access to portions of the 3D models, therefore making a Planters investment worthwhile over time. Seeders are always given the largest stake of a SEED, and therefore accrue the most WATER. We do not pretend to know the feasibility of such a system entirely, but know the bones are good and would rely on the community to help us build. Invest in ideas, they said.

Tertiary education can be a bit scary and students can do with a little help from knowledgeable people in their field but even the fact that the possibilities available with regards to tertiary education is so widely scattered across the internet makes it even so difficult.\nJust imagine a platform where students can have access to institutions and businesses around them or where they can seek help from knowledgeable people and study groups from their field.\nAnd to crown it all, wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful to have all this in one easy to use platform? Well, there\u2019s good news.\nFROSHFEEL, a decentralized peer-to-peer student platform where students, professionals, businesses, institutions and educators can interact with one another on an educational level while combining the social elements of a student\u2019s life and caters for a variety of young markets.\nThe users of the Froshfeel platform are; Institutions, Students, Business and educators. Froshfeel uses blockchain technology which ensures absolute transparency, secure and user-friendly platform. The creation of their token FROINS makes it easy to perform transactions such as paying college fees, student flights, buying textbooks, etc. and funds are not held by any third party and received instantly.\n\nWhy Froshfeel?\nAs a Contributor, you may be asking why you should contribute to this project. There are numerous unique selling points that form part of the froshfeel platform, however the most prominent are listed below:\n\n1)Froshfeel aims to address the lack of resources and educational assistance available to students. The froshfeel platform is both an educational and social network intended for students. We aspire to build a large database of users that will be made available to businesses and institutions.\n\n2)The student market consists of approximately 1.2 billion people. The need for a single platform, that combines all elements of a student\u2019s tertiary educational journey and beyond, has become imperative. Froshfeel enables users to seek information, ask for educational assistance for exams and assignments, browse all available institutions and qualifications, view and apply to jobs and network with like-minded users. Users will also be able to buy and sell a variety of products and services through the platform.\n\n3)Institutions will be able to provide particulars on qualifications available, contact details, locations, registrations processes , galleries and other essential information on the froshfeel platform.\n\n4)Businesses will have access to our database in order to showcase and sell their products and services directly to users on the platform, anywhere around the world.\n\n5)Educators will have the option to create classes, offer tutoring services, provide assistance to student users, host events and more\n\nFEATURES OF FROSHFEEL\n\u2022 The \u201cclasses\u201d feature will enable social discussions on classes, events, and this feature can also be used by Tutors, Mentors, Lecturers and Teachers for the creation of private classes where slides and notes can be uploaded. Real time student discussions are also possible with this feature\n\u2022 The Job portal is another feature where part-time and full-time jobs will be listed by institutions and businesses for students. Students will be able to upload their CV\u2019s/resumes on this feature\n\u2022 Students will be able to see on the Froshfeel platform, the kind of courses that are available for study in a particular university, the requirement for these courses, and Froshfeel users will have a guidance tool enabled on the platform that guides them on course selection based on their interest\n\u2022 A question and answer forum will be available to users of the Froshfeel platform on Social, Educational and Life style categories.

We are collecting hints and impressions from our users in order to develop and deploy a first ready-to-market version. We plan to release it before November the 1st, 2020. So, on that date, you could expect to see the first version of the OpenBits perpetual beta. And since we are in the context of the permanent Web, that one will be the OpenBits Permanent Perpetual Beta.\u00a0\n\nTo achieve that, we have scheduled the following phases:\u00a0\n\nBeta Phase 1 - due October the 1st, 2020 - enlarge the community and the developers team. For this phase we are planning to open several bounties and opportunities on GitCoin and CommunityXYZ. \n\nBeta Phase 2 - due October the 15th, 2020 - improving marketing and modularise software. During this phase, we will put effort on marketing strategies in order to make OpenBits more known around the developers community and the Web3 community. Also, we will work on modularising the software so it can be better adapted to be used by third parties (and so to allow other types of packages different by the node.js ones).\n\nBeta Phase 3 - due November the 1st, 2020 - usability and funding. During this phase, we will work on improving the usability of OpenBits and we\u2019ll release a new \u201cstable\u201d version of it. After having done that, we will move forward to search for new funds to evolve OpenBits.\u00a0\n\nFunding obtained by means of this grant will be used to support the three phases described above and will be allocated as following:\u00a0\n\n25% allocated to bounties related to development tasks;\n25% allocated to support operations needed for improving and extending our community;\n25% allocated to operations related to marketing and communication\u00a0\n25% allocated to the core developing and managing team.\n\nSupport OpenBits!

This would create a standard for the industry and make it much easier and faster for newer research organizations to work on more pressing hyperloop problems. The Hard Tech Fund is looking to help manage this project; they ran an open research symposium for hyperloop symposium at the end of last month (https://www.hardtechfund.com/hyperloop.html) and are committed to a mission of transparent hyperloop development worldwide. Would you be interested in donating to this effort to help expand high speed, renewable transportation?\u00a0\n\nIntroduction\u00a0\nHyperloop is a transportation concept based on the idea of having a vacuum chamber that is used as the medium of transfer for a set of pods, each fitting 5 to 80 people ideally. The idea was first proposed back in 2013 with the advent of Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cHyperloop Alpha\u201d whitepaper, though it has existed in popular culture ever since the large scale use of pneumatic tubing in the late 1900s.\n\nYet, even nearly a decade after the writing of Elon Musk\u2019s whitepaper, numerous feasibility studies, and a multitude of student and professional teams building hyperloop pod designs and structures for both the SpaceX Hyperloop Competition and infrastructural development around the world, there does not yet exist a standard controls system architecture for use across all hyperloop pods, forcing teams to spend thousands of dollars and, more importantly, thousands of hours to develop their own.\u00a0\n\nWhy is this a problem?\nHyperloop\u2019s key usage is as a method of transportation for people, followed by a method of transportation for freight. For either existing infrastructural systems, a coherent, standardized set of controls architecture already exists; the automotive industry has the CANbus standard, and the railway industry has a standard set of coupler linkages per country they operate in. Not only does this standardization ensure that all controls systems lead to safe and secure applications, but they ensure that small companies and large companies alike can operate hyperloop pods on the same underlying infrastructure without fault.\n\nThe SpaceX Hyperloop Competition pushes for thinking along the lines of safety and security by ensuring that its teams are building controls systems that have fail safes and scalable operational systems at both the design stage of the competition and when the top 20 teams in the design category actually attend the competition at the SpaceX headquarters. In doing so, it even provides recommendations of hardware needed to build these systems, as the issue of safety is already paramount at the competition level; an uncontrolled pod in a 1 mile vacuum chamber could implode. Last year, the recommended piece of technology was a Ubiquiti Networks branded wireless link. But, this does not go far enough, as the actual controls devices used can be either really cheap microcontroller devices rigged togethers, such, as Arduinos, or really expensive programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and the code needed to be written for both is largely different.\u00a0\n\nThus, a gap emerges: teams with strong business development skillsets and great connections build sophisticated systems with PLCs, while teams with weaker business development skills and fewer connections in the industry develop cheaper controls systems.\n\nGreat, but doesn\u2019t that self select who should be building hyperloops and who shouldn\u2019t be? After all, hyperloop development is expensive and will only take place with a public-private partnership.\nMore than the money, the time spent on controls setup and coding forces most hyperloop organizations that are starting out to focus on the bare minimum pod setup needed before working on solving new problems in the industry. While this would be fine in any other, well established transportation industry, this prevents strong growth in hyperloop, which depends on new engineers, business developers,and designers to bring new perspectives to solve new problems towards the development of a full scale hyperloop system.\u00a0\n\nAs such, there has been little innovative growth in the hyperloop world: problems around the power requirements of the scaling of vacuum systems, the airlock systems that would be needed in order to facilitate stations for unloading and loading, the method of multi-track routing, and the structural implements needed to support a steel tube have yet to truly be solved, or even thoroughly addressed. While larger hyperloop companies, such as Virgin Hyperloop One and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, are undoubtedly finding solutions to these problems, the task of building controls systems from scratch prevents many other, talented researchers with much less time and fewer personnel from being able to properly participate in the development of this new field.\u00a0\n\nWonderful. But, what are you going to do about this?\nThe Hard Tech Fund is facilitating collaboration between Cooper Hyperloop, HyperXite, Hyperloop IITB, and Strathloop to develop a shared controls software architecture for hyperloop pods that can be scaled effectively across microcontroller and PLC setups. To do this, we aim to focus on connectivity to the core components of the hyperloop pod, which includes the linear induction motors (LIMs) used to move the pod forward, the eddy current and kinetic brakes used to stop the pod, the stability and suspension system used to keep the pod level, along with a strong network access panel implementation and secondary system setup across all contact points to ensure that communication to the pod is done easily and quickly, and a lack of communication can lead to a safe shutdown.\u00a0\n\nWe aim to complete this project by January 2021 to allow for ample preparation time and further system adjustment of the controls systems for upcoming hyperloop pod competitions, which look to include the SpaceX Hyperloop Competition, AZLoop\u2019s Hyperloop Competition, and a European Hyperloop Competition. After this point, further maintenance will be completed yearly as part of the Hard Tech Fund Hyperloop Symposium to ensure that the software remains current and that no one team has the burden of completing all the controls work themselves.\n\nHow much are you looking to raise? How will funds be used and distributed?\u00a0\nWe are looking to raise a minimum of 5,000 DAI. The funds will be distributed equally amongst the teams and the Hard Tech Fund, with each team and the Hard Tech Fund receiving 25% of the money. Distribution will occur via Aragon DAO according to these rules. The funds received by the teams will be used to pay for a programmable logic controller, a set of microcontrollers, electronics equipment to allow for the transfer of signals from propulsion, braking devices to the logic controllers, and to partially subsidize salaries of team members who work half or full time on the controls development. All funding received by the Hard Tech Fund will go into subsidizing salaries of the team working on managing controls scaling.\u00a0All transactions completed by the Hard Tech Fund with their share of the money thereafter will be publicly posted ETH transactions to ensure that there is full transparency in the use of funds by the organization. If more than 100,000 DAI is raised, Hard Tech Fund will set up community based voting to complete further breakup of its portion of the funds to more hyperloop teams.\n\nWhat is the future of this project after its completion?\u00a0\nWe hope that this controls work will go be the beginnings of a standardized hyperloop controls system that is adopted by the NETT Council, the Government of Maharashtra, the Government of of Toulouse, and other municipalities looking to engage in hyperloop specific work, and we look for them and their corporate partners to be attendees at the next Hyperloop Symposium to help line up that development.\u00a0\n\nMore importantly, we hope this work cuts development time for newer hyperloop teams with regards to pod development, and pushes them to focus on harder, more pressing issues of hyperloop scalability, especially relating to the vacuums.\u00a0\n\nLastly, if hyperloop at scale does turn out to be too infeasible even after further development work, we hope that the structure of collaborative editing that we have run through our Hyperloop Symposium and this fair division of funds and human resources of development will endure into further infrastructure projects.\u00a0\n\nWho are the participating organizations?\u00a0\nCooper Hyperloop, HyperXite, Strathloop, and Hyperloop IITB are three university-based hyperloop organizations that are working together on this initiative. They have all published papers on the work that their teams have completed or aim to complete, with HyperXite and Hyperloop IITB focused on pod design and Strathloop focusing on energy and airlock scalability, which were all submitted to the Hard Tech Fund Hyperloop Symposium on Aug 22-23 and 29-30. You can view the reviews for papers on Weekend 1 here (https://www.hardtechfund.com/symposium1.html) and weekend 2 here (https://www.hardtechfund.com/symposium2.html). Papers will be available on the site shortly.\n\nCooper Hyperloop: The Cooper Hyperloop team was founded in 2018 as an extracurricular club for students of The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York City. It is an undergraduate student-led team currently composed of 16 hard working Mechanical, Electrical and Chemical engineers. Cooper Hyperloop\u2019s goal is to design a scalable and rugged and safe prototype of a Hyperloop pod in order to spur research and development in this revolutionary method of transportation. Since 2018 the team has expanded and been integrated into Cooper Unions\u2019s curriculum, allowing members to receive course credit for their efforts.\u00a0\nIn 2019 The team competed in SpaceX\u2019s Hyperloop competition IV and placed in the top 40 teams globally. In 2020 the Cooper Hyperloop participated in the Hard Tech Fund\u2019s Symposium.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nHyperXite: HyperXite has been established since SpaceX Hyperloop Competition was first introduced in 2015.\u00a0HyperXite is a student-led team that participates in the Hyperloop competition. Through researching and developing prototypes, we aim to revolutionize the transportation industry at a low cost, while ensuring the safety, health and welfare of the public.\u00a0\n\nHyperXite has competed in the past four Spacex Hyperloop Pod Competitions.\nIn Competition I, HyperXite was one of the semifinalists and placed fifth for their overall design worldwide. Additionally, the HyperXite pod was one of the only air levitated pods to be tested within the Hyperloop itself during Competition II and placed in the top 6. In the past two competitions, HyperXite was one of the top 22 finalists to attend competition in Hawthorne, CA.\nOur team, currently consisting of 20 members, is working to research, design, build, and validate a small-scale pod to be tested on the team\u2019s own test track.\nBecause of the delayed competition this year, our funding has considerably decreased. With the help of this grant, we are hoping to reach our goal of manufacturing a mini prototype pod that we would be able to test and develop throughout the school year.\n\n\nStrathloop: Strathloop was founded in October 2018 within the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, UK.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, the team of 90 students is researching and developing a series of Hyperloop systems feasibility projects, along with other projects focusing on assessing and developing the infrastructure required to make Hyperloop possible.\u00a0\nOver the coming University session, Strathloop plans to design and manufacture a fully functional Hyperloop pod prototype for entry into the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition. Control Systems design will be right at the heart of the pod prototype project. With current COVID-19 restrictions, control systems have been the only sub-team able to continue its physical testing plan throughout the summer months.\u00a0\n\nTherefore, grant funding would be a useful asset to this development in collaboration with the other teams in our consortium to develop a system architecture that is useful not only for the pod prototype, but for the Hyperloop concept as a whole.\n\nHyperloop IITB: Hyperloop IITB was established in Sept. 2019 at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India with the vision to participate in the SpaceX hyperloop pod competition and promote research and interest in the Hyperloop technology within the student community.\n\nThe team, currently, consists of 50 students working in different subsystems- Aerodynamics, Dynamics and Levitation, Controls and Power, Propulsion, Structure, Marketing and Design- to build a small scale prototype of the Hyperloop pod. Our team, though being relatively new, has proved it\u2019s mettle in competitions like Arizona desert loop competition and the Inter IIT Design conclave.\u00a0\n\nDue to the uncertainty of the final dates of the competition due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our team is low on funds. The factor of being a new team just adds to the challenge.With this grant, we hope to work at a greater pace to develop the small scale model for test run as soon as possible.\n\nHard Tech Fund: Hard Tech Fund was started in 2019 at UC Davis as a way to turn projects coming out of Oneloop, Davis' Hyperloop Team, into products and services in order to help spur full hyperloop development in the Sacramento Valley. In fact, it was even part of the team's whitepaper for future development, which was shared with the Sacramento Area Council of Governments and the UC Davis Chancellor, Gary May.\n\nIn order to prove that the team could be given money to help fund these new startups, Hard Tech Fund started a summer program from June to August of 2019 to help any team working on sustainability related ideas due to the demand for a hands-on, product focused incubator at UC Davis. This program ended with a demo day at the Blockchain Center in San Francisco and was attended by seed and pre-seed investment groups. Of the 3 teams who participated in Hard Tech Fund, 1 team went on to be provided further resources for further development.\n\nSeeing a greater need for sustainability product development programs at UC Davis, Hard Tech Fund created a student specific organization called Hard Tech Campus, which is a UC Davis student club, and refocused on hyperloop development to investigate how to best help existing teams and to work towards the ideals set up by the Oneloop whitepaper, which led to the creation of this symposium.\n\nThe team behind Hard Tech Fund is multidisciplinary. Blake Anneberg, Director of Outreach, is the founder of InTheHyperloop, the best and only hyperlooop-specific YouTube channel, and the Colorado Hyperloop Coalition. Linda Huang, Director of Design, is a founding employee and Lead Designer at Ethicli, a browser extension to help consumers by online ethically. Kirk McGregor, Director of New Initiatives, is an independent grant writer working on high technology projects, such as high performance computing (HPC), x-ray technology, and quantum computation. Samarth Sandeep, President, is currently the founder of Iff, a biomaterial design company, and previously served as the Business Team Director at Oneloop. \n\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-16T17:36:42.650Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks ago", "sybil_score": "-1.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "INFRA TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/gravityshouldbenaut", "handle": "gravityshouldbenaut", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/37fead64f829dd3e771afb4d6f746b0a/gravityshouldbenaut.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]], "last_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "15\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "0.0000", "positive_round_contributor_count": 0, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "democratized-controls-architecture-for-the-develo", "url": "/grants/1160/democratized-controls-architecture-for-the-develo", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "DAI", "admin_address": "0x792FEf6EB8A7d6CA0b18ed1Fd518767E7d45d8DE", "token_address": "0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1161, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/8b357b339aa3e6649a88cd5cc09c095e/IMG_20200912_061739_0.jpg", "details_url": "/grants/1161/cryptotab-browser", "title": "cryptotab browser ", "description": "\n", "last_update": "2020-09-14T20:25:23.781Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks, 2\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-1.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/luckylukee", "handle": "luckylukee", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/45d5644bcb8a9cf81b25e12e69408bb2/luckylukee.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]], "last_clr_calc_date": "14\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "5\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "0.0000", "positive_round_contributor_count": 0, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "cryptotab-browser", "url": "/grants/1161/cryptotab-browser", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x63cc9fb31ea26bc8fe4688614ae70d3714f1f324", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": false}, {"id": 1168, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/3dd9fb946b530ba83def4fd863e3a611/Cheerful_Koala.png", "details_url": "/grants/1168/flowerpatch-emojis-artwork-fund", "title": "Flowerpatch Emojis & Artwork Fund", "description": "Hi Alvitans! \n\nThe Flowerpatch team has commissioned one of our very own community members, Scott to create emojis for the chat and in-game.

It allows borrowers to put up assets for a loan and lenders to make offers to lend in return for interest.\nArt and collectible markets in general suffer from less liquidity than fiat, equity or other types of assets. However, this is even truer for NFTs as it is still very early days and matching buyers and sellers can take time. New exciting projects go live all the time, but existing players and collectors often have a lot of their crypto wealth tied up in existing NFTs already, so this liquidity issue compounds. Players might miss out on great opportunities or having to sell too cheap to raise cash. Similarly we feel it is a great opportunity for other users to get a return on their ETH while helping the NFT ecosystem instead of just parking it in Maker, Compound or somewhere else. For the astute investor it should provide a more profitable and fun opportunity for a financial return too.\n\nHow does NFTfi work?\nIf you go to the borrow tab of the site you will see all your own NFT assets listed. To put up an asset for a loan, simply click on one of your assets, and click \u201clist as collateral\u201d to sign for the asset to be listed. Your NFT will now appear to other users on the loan marketplace and can receive offers.\nOnce one or several other users have made a loan offer to you for that asset it will change colour to blue. If you click the asset, you will now be able to accept a loan. Accepting an offer causes your NFT to be locked in the contract as collateral and the loan to be paid into your wallet as wETH. Your NFT will now appear in yellow on your \u201cBorrow\u201d screen, indicating it is in escrow.\nIf a loan is not paid back in time by the borrower, the asset becomes available for foreclosure by the lender. As a lender you don\u2019t have to foreclose immediately, but if you do, the NFT will be transferred to your account and you will waive your claim for the outstanding loan amount. This is called a\u00a0non-recourse loan\u00a0in the normal art/collectible world. In short your loan is directly guaranteed by the NFT itself as collateral, and the asset will sit in escrow in our contract until the borrower has completed the repayment.\nThis simple mechanism, enabled by our contract, allows lenders and borrowers to interact in a safe, trustless and decentralized way.\n\u00a0\nWhy does the NFTfi use wETH?\nWrapped Ether have multiple benefits in the context of NFTfi. wETH is an ERC20 and unlike with standard ETH the ERC20 standard allows the token holder to grant other ethereum accounts permission to spend their tokens. By giving the NFTfi smart contract permission to mange your wETH it becomes possible to make offers using only a signature. It also means we can move the wETH during the start loan and repay loan process.\nIt also means that lenders can make multiple loan offers on different NFTs with the same wETH balance, reducing liquidity needs and improving platform efficiency and usefulness. This is similar to Opensea offers.\nYou can easily convert your ETH to wETH (and back) 1:1 on\u00a0Opensea\n\nYou can follow us on Twitter for more information.

I am open for suggestions from the community. \n\nI am looking for feedback over funding. (So if you have the time, watching the videos and sending me some feedback is already more than I can ask for)\n\nNevertheless, I am working a full time job and am thus limited in terms of time.

Making good items scarce.\n\nPlayers will be divided into three different factions, that compete for world resources and political power.\nAnother core concept is the idea of in game politics, using a governance token that is distributed to players according to their in game activity(Exactly how has not been decided yet). \nBy voting, players can decide about in game events, what way the game development will take, when a certain season will end. The possibilities are endless. \nKeeping and holding certain areas in game would make your faction recieve more tokens than the other factions, incentivising PvP and activity.\n\nI have been working on this project pretty much full time the last 5 months, due to corona. \n\nAny funds recieved by this grant will be used to make this game better and to make players who are not involved in crypto to understand Ethereum.

We use our brains to dream up fantastical and impossible things. Artists bring these things to life. This looks like paintings, music, writing, and more. Many of our favorite stories and memories are because of art. We love these things so much we\u2019re willing to pay for them, sometimes at tremendous valuations. The problem is, when art gets resold at higher and higher multiples the artists don\u2019t get a piece of those profits. As a result, the phrase \u201cstarving artist\u201d is a stereotype that is often associated with creatives. It\u2019s very hard to make any money creating art! It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. With Mol LeArt, artist can create content, then tokenize it with LexArt tokens, and that token contract will enforce revenue sharing of secondary sales with the artist. Now artists can get the full value of their art vs just the first price someone is willing to buy it at. Mol LeArt puts the power back in the hands of the artists.\r\n\r\nDAO Mechanism \u2699\ufe0f \r\nValue creation from LexArt tokens will be tied to DAO shares. This might look like a fee to use LexArt and/or setting the DAO\u2019s guildbank as a recipient of a portion of secondary art sales. More research is needed to determine how this will work, but the initial setup fee seems like the easiest way forward.\r\nThose who create value for LexArt will receive DAO shares. Anyone can submit a proposal to the DAO offering to do work and requesting the amount of shares they would like in return. The current DAO members (also contributors) can review the request and then approve or deny it. Work request might include, but not be limited to: content marketing to help explain LexArt tokens and how to use them, creating a new front-end, updating the website, etc\u2026 Because current contributors vote in new contributors, it ensures that proposals that wash out the rest of the community will be rejected and/or past contributors will be able to rage-quit before the proposal goes through.\r\n", "last_update": "2020-09-15T17:55:08.917Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks, 1\u00a0day ago", "sybil_score": "-0.6667", "weighted_risk_score": "1.4603", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/audsssy", "handle": "audsssy", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/aa05e90fd5aa5118c406a921e3041d3a/stamfordh.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 9.2254978515675, 0.0], [1.0, 15.276404695014, 6.0509068434465], [10.0, 17.6674791506607, 8.44198129909322], [100.0, 20.0050543932364, 10.7795565416689], [1000.0, 21.4781662341273, 12.2526683825598], [10000.0, 22.1217184302759, 12.8962205787084]], "last_clr_calc_date": "3\u00a0minutes from now", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "23\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "2380.3398", "positive_round_contributor_count": 3, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "mol-leart", "url": "/grants/1206/mol-leart", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xF09631d7BA044bfe44bBFec22c0A362c7e9DCDd8", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1207, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/799da8f12a04f2a2055ab70018be6370/0.jpg", "details_url": "/grants/1207/wallid-store-id-documents-in-a-digital-wallet", "title": "WalliD - Store ID Documents in a Digital Wallet", "description": "What is WalliD?\nWalliD integrates certified ID document infrastructures (PKIs) from all over the world and connects them to the web-3, allowing users to digitize their physical ID documents, encrypt and store them on the blockchain using their Wallets as gateway.\nWalliD provides the tools for users to store their ID documents in their desktops or phones while maintaining total ownership of their data - You will never need to create an account or share any personal data with us. Everything is handled and protected by your wallet. All data stored on the blockchain or any other components related to the protocol are encrypted with your own keys and you are their sole owner.\nWalliD also delivers a set of technological components to be used for online services in order to request and validate users\u2019 ID documents issued by CAs, directly in their technological infrastructures - PKIs - Everything happens in their websites or apps and they directly request your authorisation to access your wallet and share your ID documents. We are a team of developers on a quest to deliver full ownership to online users when it comes to their ID data and we will keep working everyday to make it as easy and useful as it is to turn your phone or desktop on.\n\u00a0\nUsers' privacy and safety on the protocol\n\nAll ID data is encrypted with user\u2019s wallet private keys and only the user has the ability to decrypt it.\nAll the interactions with the protocol components are handled by user\u2019s wallet in browser or phone, eliminating the need to have accounts or logins.\nNot even WalliD components have access to users\u2019 data when they're manipulating it.\nData is only decrypted directly on users' trusted services. No more documents travelling through unsafe channels.\n\u00a0\nWe dream of a world where owning and using an ID document in the digital space is as easy and safe as it is in the real world\nOur daily activities have been greatly shifting to the digital world and a high volume of them require identity validation processes to be safely or legally completed. In the current days, users often need to take pictures of their ID documents and send them through unsafe channels multiple times,exposing their ID data to high risks of potential fraud. For businesses these ID validations are also a burden since they are extremely unfriendly to their users, take from 12 hours to 4 days to be complete and require expensive processes to implement and rely on third parties and human intervention as middle men. However, with the existing technology of digital certificates and public key infrastructures (PKI), there\u2019s actually no reason for the existence of such archaic processes - It is mathematically possible to be sure that the ID document being presented belongs to right person according to a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) like a government.\n\nCryptographic proofs-of-identity\n\nBlockchain Powered Safety:\nWalliD is built on top of the Ethereum Blockchain and users can interact with it through their wallets in their desktops or mobile devices at anytime and anywhere\nAll iD Data handled by WalliD is protected and encrypted by users' wallet keys and he their sole owner.\nUsers' ID attributes are stored in WalliD's smart contract, ensuring the data integrity of future ID related transactions.\n\nTrustless Validations:\nCertified Documents are always verified within Certificate Authorities infrastructures (PKI) and do not depend on any middle men.\nWalliD validator (VerifyiD) connects users\u2019 IDs to CAs\u2019 PKIs and provides a proof of the methods applied in it.\n\nDigital Certificates at the roots of the ID documents:\nThe protocol is only compatible with documents with digital certificates attached.\nDigital Certificates are used as a mathematical proof of ownership for an ID document.\nAll documents stored and shared through WalliD components are able to provide a chain of trust from their issuer to their owner verifiable in a trustless way.\n\nYou can connect with us via Twitter or by joining our Facebook page.\nYou can also help us develop this project to a better form by supporting this grant through contributions or share the link with friends. \n", "last_update": "2020-09-15T17:56:42.223Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0weeks, 1\u00a0day ago", "sybil_score": "-3.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/filepeveiga", "handle": "filepeveiga", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/a9664e9c20402e7fc1cea168360f0f28/marcobraghim.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.821644674816149, 0.821644674816149], [10.0, 1.62475950481634, 1.62475950481634], [100.0, 2.35164344951094, 2.35164344951094], [1000.0, 2.73916325885472, 2.73916325885472], [10000.0, 2.8897485257111, 2.8897485257111]], "last_clr_calc_date": "27\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "3.3393", "positive_round_contributor_count": 1, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "wallid-store-id-documents-in-a-digital-wallet", "url": "/grants/1207/wallid-store-id-documents-in-a-digital-wallet", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xA1983EA8a29ae969a791B047b5C2Ef3BD7895667", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1209, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/4526a5be98ce00ddbee2990a83628ed4/porium2.png", "details_url": "/grants/1209/porium", "title": "Porium", "description": "Online education is built on a broken business model with consequences like theoretical vs practical skills gaps.

Our mission is to create delightful, practical experiences that promote learning/reading engagement, comprehension and retention.\r\n\r\nWe have built the first ever VR book library and platform, and have articulated a pipeline from which similar VR books can be made. Our mobile platform hosts our VR experiences and will eventually host more than only Peeka's experiences. Today, Peeka is live classrooms in SC, ID and exhibiting in WA and more.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcda AN EDUCATIONAL CRYPTO VR EXPERIENCE FOR KIDS AND ADULTS\r\nAs founders who are as interested in Ethereum as they are in virtual reality, we've wanted to use VR to help kids understand the technology of Ethereum while they're still growing and learning. \r\n\r\nThis is an opportunity to create a unique, educational, and delightful piece of content that can help onboard new generations to Ethereum and crypto at large. \r\n\r\nWe want to use the proceeds of the grant to put towards a new, immersive experience that will teach kids and adults alike about crypto: how it works, why it's important, and how to get started. This experience will be based on an existing story, the ever-popular \"B is for Bufficorn\" by ETH Denver's John Paller. \r\n\r\nSee Vitalik, John, and Jared Polis (Gov of CO) reading B is for Bufficorn at ETH Denver. \r\n\r\n\ud83e\udd1d DESIGNING THE EXPERIENCE TOGETHER\r\nIn addition to helping us decide which story or form our experience should take on, you'll also be part of a group that helps shape what our experience will be like, including advisement from Ethereum community members like David Hoffman (@trustlessstate) and others.\r\n\r\nHere's some quick facts for you to consider about our production:\r\n Our pipeline for making content here in Seattle allows us to turn an experience around (based on an existing book) in 12 weeks or less. \r\n We build all our experiences in Unity, and while we're mobile-based now, we can port to Oculus or HTC Vive whenever. \r\n We can make the experience do whatever we want together, and communicate the most important points.\r\n We have a pipeline of schools, exhibits, and customers who will want to get ahold of this experience as soon as it ships. \r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcf2 MORE PEEKA LINKS\r\n\r\nOur website\r\nOur apps\r\nA demo to our experiences\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you Gitcoin!

We were invited to present our team and our work at the Thiva Antiracist Festival 2019 , And we introduced our culture by performing music and dance.\n\nThis was described as unique: the first participation by a refugee group with such a perspective on active citizenship. And from this we were invited to be one of the groups creating and organising the first Solidarity Festival by refugees and migrants in the city .\u00a0\n\nWe already built connection with employers who are hiring our community members to do part time jobs in agricultural work, to maintain our costs but also to support our learning by doing !    \n\nNow, we are looking to build on these connections, aiming to provide food sustainability and employment, and to develop our cultural exchange with the local market by introducing new products.\n\nAlso to offer a healing experience to those who visits us by being close to the earth , interacting with the nature and animals, and further more to launch a DAO prototype for our project .\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the Plan?\n\nThe concept of our own DAO was born out of the HACKUMENTA workshops in Athens, organised by the Trojan DAO and Agency DAO, where we used the DAO Canvas methodology to design a DAO specially for the governance of this project.\u00a0\n\nLaunching the SGYF DAO pilot we seek to enable the following:\n\nOur community members will be empowered to share in the common benefit of the outputs of the project and participate in group decision making. To enable our community members to democratically govern this project, and award contributions.To collaborate with other teams from other locations whose goals align with ours.\n\nTo transparently track how funds are being used in the project and that they're being used within accepted boundaries.\nOur long-term goal to help create a sustainable and fair regenerative economy for our community, and to prove a new co-ownership and active citizenship model.\n\nOnce the DAO is launched, all funds collected for this grant will be deposited into our DAO to kickstart our Agricultural project in Thiva!\n\n\nThis year we rented a piece of land of 8000sq.m in Erythres, a village 10 minutes away from the city of Thiva, where we are planting and growing vegetables and herbs to produce traditional Syrian Moneh. with an access to a winery to produce wine, tsipouro and raki.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n                         \n   .   \n\n\n   \nMoneh \u2013 food products consumed and stored all year long !!\u00a0including cheeses, yoghurt, pickled vegetables, and sauces \u2013 has supported the Syrian economy for hundreds of years.\n\nWe aim to share this culture with the Greek society as a tool of food sustainability while thousands of families who live in and around Athens are struggling to maintain their daily needs.\n\n\n                                                                             \n\n\n\n\nWe have spotted multiple apartments for rent at the village and we are planing and working on renting 3 apartments on the site, where three families with agricultural expertise will live and work. and we are working on finding ways to cover the cost of a 6 months period . This is the time needed to turn the land into a fully sustainable site of food production.\n\n\nOur agricultural project will also provide employment opportunities for others, and we are developing a flexible working system to support the maximum number of people possible. We will also assist people seeking other jobs in and around Thiva, and are developing a plan to serve as a guarantor for people renting apartments in the area from 2021.\nMaking it Sustainable\nTo complete this cycle, and in collaboration with the Solidarity felids project, we will run\u00a0a social cafe \u2013 Collectiva \u2013 in the Exarcheia neighbourhood of Athens. (We are in the process of setting this up as a farming association, which will be the first such institute in Athens.)\n\nThere we will sell and market our products, host social and cultural events, and offer further employment opportunities for the active members of the community who are unable to reach jobs in and around Athens\u00a0\u00a0.\nThe profits that we make from this enterprise will be managed on a community level, and will go back into the farming project: replanting the land, expanding our production and distribution capacities, investing in our business operations in Athens, and generating more jobs in the process.\n\nOur ultimate goal with this project is to set up a full-scale food production operation in the area around Thiva, with jobs and housing for c.250 people.\n\n\nWhat do we Need?\n\nWe need \u20ac5000 to get the project up and running. This includes the costs for the land, for the production space, and transportation costs between the sites. Please find the budget breakdown below. We have calculated that our monthly running costs for the project once we have everything setup will be \u20ac700pcm (covering gas for our van, land maintenance costs and general expenses), and we expect to make the project self-sustainable by generating the revenue to cover our own costs gradually . We are very happy to answer any questions and to discuss this further.

Custody for Web3 through Security and Access", "description": "Note: We are currently participating in Gitcoin/Protocol Labs' APOLLO Fellowship. For more information, check out our updates at guer.substack.com\n\nWith Web3, we have an opportunity to redefine who maintains the custody of data, without compromising functionality, convenience, or accessibility. \n\nRather than require custody of data, applications can provide services to data. \n\nFor end-users, this translates into greater control over how, when, and by who their data is accessed and utilized. \n\nFor organizations, less resources are claimed by storing and securing end-user data, allowing focus on core services and applications.\n\nBlockchain, decentralized storage, and other decentralized services such as resolving and hosting are the building blocks for remodeling online data custody. \n\nGuer is building the transport-layer protocols and functionality to bridge these decentralized services to help realize this vision for Web3. \n\nSpecifically,\n\nWeb3-Native Transport Layer Security and Encryption\nA decentralized web deserves decentralized security. Rather than rely on IP addresses, Certificate Authorities, or DNS Resolvers for TLS, Guer has built a Web3 handshake scheme for trustless key generation and distribution. \n\nThis handshake enables any two parties with Ethereum Addresses the ability to securely communicate, without any dependency on third parties. By using networked Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), we introduce hypervisor-safe, bare-metal security for all devices. \n\nWe have also modeled, and are testing a decentralized proxy re-encryption service using the same tech stack, which would allow Web3 to shift security away from client-side encryption without losing functionality. \n\nSmart Contract-based Access Management\nUsing smart contracts, content uploaded to decentralized storage networks is assigned a unique token which manages access to that data, effectively \"owning\" that data. This token is responsible for verifying party identities, their relationship with that data, and facilitating the security handshake when approved. \n\nThis is intended as a global, agnostic, programmable access management system which will allow end-users more control over their digital footprint.\n\nIntegrations and Implementations\nBoth the security and access services are designed to network and language agnostic, and as such are compatible with IPFS/Filecoin, Arweave, Swarm, Sia, Storj, and Archon. By integrating access management and security at the infrastructure, the protocol encourages interoperability and composability.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nThe Project, Status and Updates\nWe currently have working proofs of concept on Ropsten for all the services, and are working to get them ready for testing, review, and production. We aim to have a live demo using ready by the end of the APOLLO fellowship using an open-source Web 2.0 application as an example. \n\nWe're looking for resources to:\n\nConduct code reviews and audits, especially for the encryption library\nCover some of the development costs & tooling\nGet us one step closer to building full time! \n\nA note on our building philosophy\nWe try to build as much as we can Ethereum-native, or as close to Ethereum as possible. It is unlikely that special-purpose blockchain networks will reach the token economics or network/node volume required to succeed as a resilient, decentralized, sustainable networks. As such, all fees are in ETH, and all public functions are EVM-compatible. \n\nWe believe in open-source, public good services, and believe this type of security falls into that category. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read! We acknowledge there is a lot here...and would love to discuss further if you have questions.

We plan to inform musicians and their fans for opportunities that are evolving through the open source space and the Ethereum ecosystem.Educate them about the problems of ownership, payments and transparency.Protect them from middlemen, improve the income of the artists and reduce the cost for listeners to access music.\n\nThe first project that Beatnomads.art are going to work is to create a mechanism that rewards early supporters through a bonding curve token.\n\nThe idea is that when someone buys a record from a band he scans a QR code and claims some tokens. The quantity of tokens that you claim is correlated based on how many people have all ready scan the QR. For example the first take 100 token the second 80 etc.\n\nThis tokens then can be sold or give access to premium content or sell it back to them and take some money back.\n\nIn the long term we will organize lessons and online meetups for open source music tools,educate artists for the new opportunities that occurred from the Blockchain space, buy and provide the equipment for online or live dj sets and concerts, create trust between artists and fans and create new ways for fans to support their favourite artists.\n\nAs musicians we want to help ourselves and other people like us to corporate and give to our audience the best experience we can with a way that we help the music industry in general.\n\n\nOur organization will give support on this subjects:\nCreating music.\nHelp artists to find the right tools to raise money.\nProvide recording and mixing support.\nHelp them monetize their work and interact directly with their fans.\nEducate artists about Open source tools that they can use for creating their music.\nEducate them about how token economics, DAOs and Dapps can help them.\nProvide technical support for web developing and SEO for better ranking on google.\nProvide hardware support for online events.\nHelp artists to create content.\nHelp artists to record Dj sessions on beautiful locations in Greece.\nHelp artists to connect with other DAOs that can support them and have social impact.\nOrganize online DJ sets to entertain people in this difficult time of Covid19.\nGive a good reason for people to learn more about Defi.\nOrganize online and live decentralized music festivals.\nLearn about NFTs and token economics.\nCreate their own token and use it for reward fans.\n\n\n\nOther ways that you can contribute:\nIf you are an artist and you are looking for a team to support you talk to us.\nIf you are tech guy and you have found a tool that can help our community please share it with us and become a member of our community\nIf you are a fan and you want to spread the message of crypto with music and art, talk with us\n\n\nOur telegram channel is here https://t.me/joinchat/Nf_oFBk4c4l1zPuSY5EH3w\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-20T11:47:29.312Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 4\u00a0days ago", "sybil_score": "-0.2500", "weighted_risk_score": "0.1499", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/giorgosn", "handle": "giorgosn", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/ea3ef31af04f95e1990f288a872b49d3/giorgosn.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 10.1266826725256, 0.0], [1.0, 14.8200012464376, 4.69331857391193], [10.0, 19.3228762163514, 9.1961935438258], [100.0, 23.6628041205705, 13.5361214480448], [1000.0, 26.1951545584314, 16.0684718859058], [10000.0, 27.2388536245702, 17.1121709520445]], "last_clr_calc_date": "a minute from now", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "21\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "14.9942", "positive_round_contributor_count": 4, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "beat-nomads-empower-artists", "url": "/grants/1295/beat-nomads-empower-artists", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x3161fE3D8fe5223599eC17AE19247B9cA0D0BA85", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1298, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/85fc3419952be47522eadae44a7b2eaa/WhatsApp_Image_2020-09-21_at_1.14.18_AM.jpeg", "details_url": "/grants/1298/cadbury-meet", "title": "Cadbury Meet", "description": "\n\nCadbury \ud83c\udf6b is building open, neutral, border-less, decentralized and censorship resistant video chat/meeting platform powered by web 3. \n\n\nWorking Product\n\nFleek\u00a0https://cadbury.on.fleek.co/\nUnstoppable Domain => meet-cadbury.crypto\nSignaling\u00a0https://meet-cadbury.herokuapp.com/\nFlutter\u00a0https://github.com/susmit/Cadbury-Flutter\n\nCadbury Meets Flutter \ud83d\udcf2\n\n We have started building mobile (Android & IOS) version of Cadbury meet too !\n https://github.com/susmit/Cadbury-Flutter\n\nFuture work \ud83d\udd2e\n\nFor Performance / Scalability/ Decentralization Cadbury's team is working on protocol on top of libp2p that will have signaling servers,sfu,mcu,transcoders and orchestrator as actors complmenting filecoin/livepeer via off chain computation and on chain verification approach.

The importance of communities has been amplified over the past 6 months during the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of locally-based volunteers and Mutual Aid Groups (MAGs) has multiplied and have been exceptional examples of willingness of individuals to contribute to and commit to the common good and welfare of one's own community. Mutual Aid Groups were revitalized about 15 years ago from a different historic purpose. MAGs are organized by and for individuals, on the bases of non-political solidarity, reciprocity and volunteerism.\u00a0\n\n\u269b\ufe0fWhat is FightPandemics?\nFightPandemics is an open source altruistic platform that connect individuals and organizations that need help with those that can provide it at the local and global level. We are creating a world where people are more resilient to emergencies, by enabling communities coordinate and respond more quickly and effectively to crises.\u00a0\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc66Who are we?\nWe are a volunteer driven organization, to this date 4400+ have applied to join our organization and we have onboarded over 1300 people who are aligned with our values and have already contributed to our vision. We have around 30 people who have an important role within the community and we call them coordinators, they are the true engine of this open source organization as they identify the issues to be solved and connect them with the skills offered by different volunteers. Our team was born out of the need of a tool for connecting needs and resources and were not motivated to join based on money or titles, but rather belief in the social mission which are the core pillars who are leading the organization. \n\n\ud83d\udcb8Why Gitcoin Grants?\nSince the start of the organization, we haven't received any monetary (FIAT/Crypto) donations apart from what we are receiving here. All the donations that we have received, have been contributions with time from our volunteers and +35 organizations (Notion, Slack, Hopin, Airtable, Gitcoin Kernel & Apollo Fellowships + more) that have supported us with credits. The money will be used for paying for software and for organizing an online conference for +20k people (+$10k in credits sponsored by hopin.to) where we will cover the following tracks: Tech against Covid-19 / Effective responses to crises, Community Building, Epidemiology, Mental Health, The future of work after Covid, Economic trends, Disinformation, Education after COVID, Culture during COVID time (artist presenting).

Businesses can collateralize resources - tokenized business debt in the form of redeemable ERC-20 coupons pegged to goods & services - to mint \"Resources\" (rUSD). rUSD is a unit of account on the Ethereum blockchain, with each rUSD account comprising a balance - which can be positive or negative - and a credit line, from which rUSD can be minted. \n\nOn the ReSource app, businesses can list any product or service and price it in rUSD. We are building a circular economy of value between our first two types of users: co-living properties and freelancers. For improved user experience, gas fees are currently covered automagically, and lay users need not hold ETH. Our MVP app is live on Ethereum and you can interact with it here.\n\nWe\u2019re seeking financial contributions to build out the network and infrastructure\u00a0for the ReSource Network. We are also calling in non-financial contributions of skills from the community.\n\nMutual credit is a financial primitive yet to see a significant implementation on blockchain. Mutual credit is a long-standing alternative monetary system to the dominant paradigm based on compounding interest, and thrives in periods of economic downturn. The most prominent mutual credit network in existence is the Wir Bank in Switzerland, launched in the 1930's at the height of the Great Depression.\n\nReSource has an Ethereum-based inter-coupon exchange & barter system (unreleased), which will add coupon liquidity. ReSource has integrated Wyre for fiat and crypto payment processing, and is planning to integrate Matic Network to reduce Ethereum gas fees.\n\nThe problems we\u2019re addressing are access to credit, control and governance over credit systems designed to serve SME's, tools and resources for SME's to survive the economic downturn triggered by the covid-19 pandemic, and (questionable) resilience of fiat-backed monetary systems.\n\nThe governance model for the ReSource Network is currently being developed, and is inspired by MakerDao. New rUSD issuers will be curated and verified by a network of existing rUSD issuers.\n\nJoin our discussion here: https://t.me/theresourcenetwork\n\nGithub Project URL will be posted shortly.\n\nTeam members (Github handle):\n@lastperson\n@dukejones\n@Aldekein\n@Ambisafe\n", "last_update": "2020-09-23T02:17:14.356Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week, 1\u00a0day ago", "sybil_score": "1.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/numundo", "handle": "numundo", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/ba3621280ca577f3dedf4c5fabe01dc3/numundo.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.12727613437065, 1.12727613437065], [10.0, 1.95645782719484, 1.95645782719484], [100.0, 2.54948012447408, 2.54948012447408], [1000.0, 2.81975928919566, 2.81975928919566], [10000.0, 2.91756902295556, 2.91756902295556]], "last_clr_calc_date": "29\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "8.5500", "positive_round_contributor_count": 1, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "resource-network", "url": "/grants/1323/resource-network", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xcFB3c2dC81718FF0087D46e4D7b1C4692ded1586", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1324, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/0f692ca4a587a2f7b94d89fb015eb74a/Blocktrack_Registry.png", "details_url": "/grants/1324/blockchain-registry", "title": "Blockchain Registry", "description": "The Blockchain Registry is an open-source index that can be freely accessed by people in or outside the world of blockchain technology.

CuraDAO consisted of over 40 individual community members on the island who coordinated on social-impact projects through the CuraDAO DAPP. The pilot was successfully concluded in December 2019 after 9 projects being funded and organized through CuraDAO. One of the biggest issues we ran into during the pilot was the fact that most locals don't understand how to value cryptocurrencies. In February 2020 we created CuraDAI, a DAI backed stablecoin that matches the value of the local currency, the Antillean Guilder to solve this problem. With a community currency attached to it, CuraDAO started to evolve into more than just a coordination hub - it started to become an economy. We iterated on this idea during the Kickstart Innovathon, the local hackathon of the island organized by the ministry of economic development, and won! This signaled to us that the ecosystem is ready for the next step - scaling from the ~100 individuals who interacted with CuraDAO/CuraDAI to 1000s of individuals who participate. For this level of adoption to be reached, we need to sharpen our vision, improve the technology, and get even more embedded into the local ecosystem.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f As the island of Cura\u00e7ao relies heavily on Tourism, the need for an alternative system intensified during COVID-19. Currently, over 40% of the population is unemployed and food insecure. For this reason, we want to improve and scale fast! \n\nOur vision \ud83c\udf31\nKolektivo will merge all learnings and resources into a single user-friendly solution that all stakeholders can interact with and collectively coordinate through. The solution will leverage the latest insights in community currency and DAOs to create a prosperous economy that rewards social-impact initiatives fairly for their impact on the island. Once successful in Cura\u00e7ao we hope to support other countries and regions in creating their own Kolektivo economy!\n\nWhat you'll be funding!\nThe development of Kolektivo - this includes the creation of the Kolektivo DAPP on the Fuse platform, the coordination of projects and the establishment of local and international partnerships\nSupporting local social impact projects that are funded through CuraDAO. This could range from Clean-ups organized by teens to local innovation collectives being launched.\u00a0\n\nOur partners\nWe're extremely grateful to be working with some of the most passionate teams and advanced permissionless technologies in the space and on the island. Together we are Kolektivo!\n\n\n\nThanks // Danki\nThank you for enabling us to build a more prosperous foundation for our island and the world <3\n\nWebsite // Twitter // Contact\n", "last_update": "2020-09-24T08:33:01.630Z", "last_update_natural": "1\u00a0week ago", "sybil_score": "-2.8333", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/luukdao", "handle": "luukdao", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/962f100fe611d05ecd15497f2aa783c3/luukdao.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 36.3078622252102, 0.0], [1.0, 47.5218361268276, 11.2139739016174], [10.0, 53.6683147442369, 17.3604525190267], [100.0, 58.4685866468618, 22.1607244216515], [1000.0, 61.1215847946925, 24.8137225694823], [10000.0, 62.2125160314207, 25.9046538062105]], "last_clr_calc_date": "15\u00a0seconds from now", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "20\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "231.2162", "positive_round_contributor_count": 6, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "kolektivo-regenerative-economy-in-curacao", "url": "/grants/1325/kolektivo-regenerative-economy-in-curacao", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xe64e9187d513b455732fd63FD1398ecd1925A03E", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": false}, {"id": 1326, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/ba08b8d4dfc53a89d2cccb50c0d85cb2/BABO_COMMUNITY_IN_THE_FLESH_FB_profile_pic.jpg", "details_url": "/grants/1326/introducing-the-babo-socio-economic-ecosystem-proj", "title": "Introducing The BABO Socio Economic Ecosystem Project", "description": "\nIhuoma Onwunali,\u00a0also known as\u00a0Ebo,\u00a0is a Los Angeles based entrepreneur with a cross-business-disciplines background .. specifically in marketing, finance, strategy, and emerging technology such as blockchain distributed ledger technology.

Primarily, maturities have replaced market pairs (e.g. USDC6MONTH, DAI12MONTH, etc.,) and interest-rates have replaced prices. Fixed-side users are then analogous to sellers, while floating-side users then act as buyers.\n\nThis results in a construction that allows users to easily identify and arbitrate market rates without sacrificing the familiar user experience of most exchanges.\n\nOnce two users have agreed upon a fixed-rate, both users funds are pooled and minted into cTokens to earn interest on the Compound Protocol. The funds are then unable to be unlocked for the duration of the lending agreement. \n\nWhen maturity is reached, the fixed-side is paid out their fixed yield, while the floating-side is returned the remaining floating yield. \n\nPitch Deck: Deck\n\n\nToken Design/ Governance:\n\nMuch like most contemporary projects, the DefiHedge token provides token holders the ability to participate in the governance of the DefiHedge Protocol.\n\nThat said with the large community push for projects to adopt a \"Fair Launch\" (https://www.fairlaunch.capital), we spent significant effort towards designing an intermediary model that algorithmically guarantees community stakeholder plurality, without potentially sacrificing the security and sustainability of a nascent protocol. \n\nThis resulted in a token distribution that initially places governance in the hands of the DefiHedge team upon launch, while algorithmically ensuring the gradual dilution of governmental control as the protocol matures. \n\nWith the implementation of a vesting period, DefiHedge funds will be unable to be moved for a set duration. The representative influence of DefiHedge wallets is then diluted continuously after launch based on a consistent modifier. In our proposed case, 100/((x/4)+1). *\n\nToken Distribution at Launch: \n1% Compound Stakeholders\n1% Aave Stakeholders\n8% Community Initiatives\n10% Developer Fund\n10% DefiHedge\n5% Founding Team\n25% Early Investors\n40% Liquidity Providers\n\nToken Distribution after 3 Yr:\n1.16% Compound Stakeholders\n1.16% Aave Stakeholders\n9.25% Community Initiatives\n11.56% Developer Fund\n1% DefiHedge\n.5% Founding Team\n28.90% Early Investors\n46.24% Liquidity Providers\n\nLiquidity Provision:\n\nGiven the largest leap for any decentralized exchange is the provision of initial liquidity, outside our basic architecture, our protocol design is intended to provide liquidity incentives.\n\nLiquidity Provider Rewards:\nThe DefiHedge exchange will launch with negative maker fees. \n\nThis serves multiple purposes:\n\n1. Provides additional yield to attract liquidity, similar to most AMM liquidity incentives\n2. Dilutes protocol governance\n3. Increases pricing accuracy in low liquidity environments\n\nVenue Neutral:\nSimilar to the 0x protocol, our goal is not to monopolize as the only interest-rate swap venue, but to introduce swaps as a whole to the decentralized financial ecosystem.\n\nThat said, we plan to provide the infrastructure for anyone to build a swap venue. Through the implementation of a libp2p order-sharing network, multiple venues can easily share their orderbook, further incentivizing shared liquidity and providing a mechanism to punish bad actors. \n\nCompound Protocol Stakeholder Distribution:\nGiven our protocol is built on top of the Compound Protocol and we expect our userbases to overlap significantly, we believe an important step towards attracting these potential users is ensuring they are aware of DefiHedge and ensuring they are given incentive to participate in DefiHedge's future growth.\n\nWith this said, we plan to distribute DefiHedge tokens to Compound Stakeholders based on their network participation over a given period before our protocol's official launch.\n\n\nCommunity Funds:\nThe DefiHedge protocol currently plans to launch with 8% of its tokens committed towards community voted initiatives.\n\nGiven the support that Gitcoin has provided throughout Kernel, and the general support Gitcoin provides the community, the first community vote (which we will abstain from) will be regarding the size of our donation towards Gitcoin.\n\nAfter that, an emission curve will be voted upon after which we hope that there will be continued initiatives whether they be towards internal community projects like an additional exchange/tooling or web3 projects as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n*x = months after launch \n", "last_update":

And yet, Spanish is the second language with more native speakers in the world,\u00a0If previous change is made then maybe \"surpassing it.\". This imbalance inspires us to join efforts to create inclusive tools for the Hispanic community and the rest of the world.\n\nEmpanaDAO is the first decentralized autonomous organization created by Latin American entrepreneurs that designs, develops, tests, audits and governs decentralized protocols and applications, based on web3 technology. It also produces, translates and delivers educational content that will enable Latin and Caribbean people to enter this sector.\n\nThe immutability and resistance to censorship of web3 technology are the main benefits brought to us by the different blockchain protocols, and they give us the possibility to raise our socio-economic and cultural level. Among the experiments projected for EmpanaDAO, we include forming organizations and applications that safeguard value and trust without the need for intermediaries.\n\nThe main goal of EmpanaDAO is the global collaboration with projects that promote new financial systems where Latin America is an integral part. Likewise, we seek to merge the Latin American intellectual and cultural richness in order to carry out new projects that will help highlighting the presence of Spanish-speaking talent in the decentralized technology industry.\n\nThe 2020 pandemic demonstrated the need for change in governance systems. The emergency exposed the fragility of our economic system and our society's global leadership, reinforcing the importance of self-sustaining communities in problem solving.\n\nOur organization will create a decentralized and autonomous ecosystem that is a reference in Latin America.

De igual manera, se encarga de producir, traducir e impartir contenido de educaci\u00f3n que permitir\u00e1 a latinos y caribe\u00f1os entrar a este sector.\n\nLa inmutabilidad y la resistencia a la censura de la tecnolog\u00eda web3 son los principales beneficios que nos traen los diferentes protocolos blockchain y que nos brindan la posibilidad de elevar nuestro nivel socio-econ\u00f3mico y cultural. Entre los experimentos proyectados para EmpanaDAO, incluimos formar organizaciones y aplicaciones que resguarden valor y confianza sin la necesidad de intermediarios.\n\nLa meta principal de EmpanaDAO es la colaboraci\u00f3n global con proyectos que impulsen nuevos sistemas financieros donde Latinoam\u00e9rica sea parte integral.\n\nAsimismo, buscamos unir la riqueza intelectual y cultural latinoamericana para sacar adelante nuevos proyectos que ayuden a marcar la presencia del talento hispanohablante en la industria de tecnolog\u00edas descentralizadas.\n\nLa pandemia de 2020 demostr\u00f3 la necesidad de un cambio en los sistemas de gobernanza. La emergencia expuso la fragilidad de la econom\u00eda y el liderazgo sobre la sociedad a nivel mundial, reforzando la importancia de las comunidades autosostenibles para la soluci\u00f3n de problemas.\n\nNuestra organizaci\u00f3n crear\u00e1 un ecosistema descentralizado y aut\u00f3nomo referente en Latinoam\u00e9rica. \u00a1\u00danete a la creaci\u00f3n de esta comunidad, donde impulsamos el emprendimiento tecnol\u00f3gico con sabor latino!\n\n\u201cLuego de una fuerte jornada laboral, no hay nada que te regrese a una tarde con amigos, un c\u00e1lido hogar y a la riqueza cultural latina como una docena de empanadas.\"\n\nEmpanaDAO Team\n\n", "last_update": "2020-09-27T21:38:09.163Z", "last_update_natural": "3\u00a0days, 16\u00a0hours ago", "sybil_score": "-7.2000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "COMMUNITY", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/cypherbadger", "handle": "cypherbadger", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/7c135a7a5104af2d8a77d88df10adc69/cypherbadger.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 18.2753851017809, 0.0], [1.0, 25.8084166208764, 7.53303151909554], [10.0, 31.185467991267, 12.9100828894861], [100.0, 35.8938052968768, 17.6184201950959], [1000.0, 38.6145438168035, 20.3391587150227], [10000.0, 39.7477432372031, 21.4723581354222]], "last_clr_calc_date": "17\u00a0seconds ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "19\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "74.4840", "positive_round_contributor_count": 5, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "empanadao", "url": "/grants/1374/empanadao", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0xB656cD9e370F0Be5A02a85Bb70BcA7bc25f03c07", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1375, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/e782535ea1bdbdc89d1071196a11e65f/usm1a.png", "details_url": "/grants/1375/usm-a-minimalist-stablecoin", "title": "USM, a minimalist stablecoin", "description": "USM is a project to build the \"simplest possible decentralized stablecoin\".

By enriching users, Swash is the first, real step towards a new, more dignified internet. It redefines how data is collected and valued, balancing the power dynamic between online platforms and the users they serve.\u00a0\n\nSwash makes more of what already is by providing a simple and easy way to passively earn crypto, working to serve the majority to shape a fairer world and better internet.\u00a0\n\nOur goal is to continue growing Swash, bringing more value back to users. The more data there is, the more valuable it becomes. That is why we are now working on expanding our user base to become more appealing for data buyers, to ensure the Swash community receives more for their contributions.\n\nSwash has already attracted over 3200 users and is available for installation on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Kiwi, Yandex, and all chromium browsers.\u00a0\n\nGive it a go: https://swashapp.io/\n\n\nWhat problem are we trying to solve?\n\nAs the world\u2019s most valuable asset, our digital economy is fuelled by data. The top 5 tech companies alone earn at least $1000 revenue per user per year. This is generated by internet users whose data is collected without their knowledge or consent.\u00a0\n\nThe data economy is worth billions, which is currently enjoyed only by the select few. With growing inequality and the urgent need for alternative solutions that work for everyone, Swash is perfectly positioned to offer an alternative solution for users and data buyers alike.\u00a0\n\nThis is even more prevalent with increasing demands around data rights in legislation, as seen with the implementation of GDPR and now CCPA, and the demise of third-party cookie tracking methods.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s our solution?\n\nSwash is a browser extension that makes it possible to earn as you surf the web. Users simply install, browse, and earn. Swash does the rest on users\u2019 behalf and rewards them for the value they create.\n\nThe data Swash users generate gets captured, pooled, and added to a decentralized marketplace where data buyers can pay to gain access to it. The payment is then distributed to users via a smart contract and makes use of a one-to-many crypto micropayment tool called Monoplasma.\u00a0\n\n\nWeb Users\n\nSwash users receive passive income\u00a0\nThey have full control over whether their data is captured or not, with the option to opt out any time\nSwash provides a simple, secure and transparent way for individuals to monetize their data, without any extra effort\n\n\nData Buyers\n\nSwash data is diverse, reliable, has high usability and is collected ethically\nNo need to deal with shady data brokers and intermediaries, Swash makes it possible for them to interact with the users themselves\nDecentralized tech makes it possible for the value of data to be maximized, offering an efficient and transparent alternative to the current model\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nAs we grow, we will:\n\nPartner with social goods organisations\u00a0\nIntegrate with major data marketplaces\u00a0\nExpand to the mobile data market\nOffer diversified data product sets\nDevelop our ads program\n\n\nRead more about Swash:\n\nOur latest blog post\nThe evolution of Swash\nA short video explainer\n\nCointelegraph\nCoin Desk\nHarvard Business Review\nForbes\nHackernoon\n\n\nCheck us out!\n\nWebsite\nTwitter\nTelegram\nMedium\nReddit\n", "last_update": "2020-09-28T20:05:30.375Z", "last_update_natural": "2\u00a0days, 17\u00a0hours ago", "sybil_score": "4.0000", "weighted_risk_score": "0.0000", "is_clr_active": true, "clr_round_num": "DAPP TECH", "admin_profile": {"url": "https://gitcoin.co/ebkhalilzadeh", "handle": "ebkhalilzadeh", "avatar_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/279c8ac5d537fa203ae41b79db62ebff/ebkhalilzadeh.png"}, "favorite": false, "is_on_team": false, "clr_prediction_curve": [[0.0, 2.87715279149084, 0.0], [1.0, 7.11877762168951, 4.24162483019867], [10.0, 8.13607370635181, 5.25892091486097], [100.0, 8.57587871758676, 5.69872592609592], [1000.0, 8.73188932754419, 5.85473653605335], [10000.0, 8.78315553990899, 5.90600274841815]], "last_clr_calc_date": "29\u00a0minutes ago", "safe_next_clr_calc_date": "4\u00a0minutes from now", "amount_received_in_round": "346.6737", "positive_round_contributor_count": 2, "monthly_amount_subscribed": "0.0000", "is_clr_eligible": true, "slug": "swash-your-data-your-income", "url": "/grants/1376/swash-your-data-your-income", "contract_version": "2", "contract_address": "0x0", "token_symbol": "Any Token", "admin_address": "0x242752acA5c560457a3C49d17d6F7824a595af18", "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "image_css": "", "verified": true}, {"id": 1377, "logo_url": "https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/a08708ff8821778a546abf5a1c29f4cd/Intoo_-_Animation.004.jpeg", "details_url": "/grants/1377/intoo-tv", "title": "Intoo TV", "description": "In a Nutshell\n\nIntoo TV is a P2P Livestreaming Platform to Design, Share and Monetize real-life experiences.\n\nValues & USPs:\n1.
